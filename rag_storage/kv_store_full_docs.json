    "content": "Ada Chen Rekhi (00:00:00):\nIt's a terrible outcome to wake up one day and be late career and feel trapped because you have a certain lifestyle or a certain expectations of the people around you that you have to go work this job, but then you look at yourself in the mirror and you're not happy going in there. I think that's a terrible trap that we should all try to avoid as we navigate our career paths and find the thing that's most optimal for us. Which is usually a mix of career success, but also meaningfulness and alignment in the work that we're doing with our values.\n\nLenny (00:00:36):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard [inaudible 00:00:42] experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Ada Chen Rekhi. Ada is an executive coach and also the co-founder of a product called Notejoy. In her coaching practice, she focuses on helping founders scale themselves. Before starting her company, she was senior vice president of marketing at SurveyMonkey. Before that, she started a contact management startup that was acquired by LinkedIn where she ended up leading LinkedIn's marketing efforts for their growth team. Two fun facts about Ada. One, she started her current company with her husband, which we chat about whether that's a good idea or not. Also, her brother is Andrew Chen of a16z fame. In our conversation, it explains how to make better decisions with a framework she calls Curiosity Loops.\n\n(00:01:21):\nWe do a live exercise around my own personal values. She shares a bunch of advice on how to intentionally and practically build your early career path. How to thrive as a woman in Silicon Valley, when to get a coach and what you can do on your own without one and a ton more. Enjoy this episode with Ada Chen Rekhi after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:01:40):\nThis episode is brought to you by Sprig. Next generation product teams like, Robinhood, Notion and Loom rely on Sprig to uncover blind spots in their product development process. Sprig let's product teams collect user insights fast, allowing you to better understand why users take certain actions and how they feel about the experience. One of the things I love most about Sprig is that they're all about getting product teams the specific insights they need in the timeframe that they need it.\n\n(00:02:07):\nAs of today's, Sprig is making that even easier with the new and improved templates library. On this podcast, you've heard a lot about how useful templates are for companies as they grow. Sprig partnered with some of the top product teams and product thinkers to build proven playbooks, specifically to solve the biggest challenges facing product teams today from how to optimize an existing feature to improving a conversion flow to troubleshooting drop off. Sprig helps you build better products. Sprig now has a library of more than 85 templates that you can use to get started collecting user insights quickly right in your app. I especially love that Sprig builds templates specifically for product teams, and I was really excited when they ask me to create a template around product sense.\n\n(00:02:47):\nOne of the questions they get most is how to develop your product sense. So I decided to build a playbook along with Sprig on how to do that based on my experience at Airbnb and from what I've learned interviewing top product folks like, Jules Walter who wrote a whole guest post on how to build your product sense. Explore my product sense playbook and the entire Sprig templates library and build better products faster. Check it out today at sprig.com/templates. That's S-P-R-I-G.com/templates. Ada, welcome to the podcast.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:03:20):\nThanks. I'm excited to be here.\n\nLenny (00:03:22):\nSo I've heard such great things about you from a lot of people, including a bunch of guests that have been on the podcast. And you also have this really great event diagram of maybe an ideal guest for the podcast. You've done growth. You've done products. You've started a company. You're also an executive coach to founders. So there's a variety of topics I'm excited to begin too. So thanks again for being here.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:03:22):\nYeah, I'm excited to be here.\n\nLenny (00:03:45):\nAn interesting thing that I'll start with is that when we were chatting about what to focus on in our conversation, where you're emailing about this, and you did something that I thought was really interesting. You ran something called a Curiosity Loop where you pinged a bunch of your friends and asked them for input in this really structured way. So I thought I'd start there. Could you just share what this process is, so that we can learn how to maybe do it ourselves, this idea of a curiosity loop?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:04:08):\nA curiosity loop is essentially going to a whole bunch of people. In this case, I sent out an email very quickly to about 10 or 11 people and asking them, \"Hey, here are nine topics for Lenny's Podcast. What are two or three of the topics that resonate with you and why?\" And I got back such an incredible amount of information for about 20 minutes of work. I don't normally do this, but I actually showed you some of the anonymized feedback from people really just talking about what resonated and what didn't. So I came out of it just so much smarter, and curiosity loops are my method of doing so.\n\nLenny (00:04:42):\nOften, people ask friends for advice on just like, \"Hey, what should I do here? What can I maybe talk about on this podcast?\" Your approach had a lot of structure to it. So maybe two questions just like, what is the actual structure to this concept? And then two, just people... You can often ask friends for advice, but you also don't want to over bug them with questions. How do you think about just not over asking everyone questions all the time, but all decisions you want to make? So I guess the question is, when do you use this versus just not?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:05:12):\nI think that there are heavyweight and lightweight ways to use this. So the heavyweight way was what I just exemplified by saying, I sent an email and I made a doc. And on the other side, I had all of this really interesting and rich data. The lightweight way to do this is really just make it your ongoing theme of what you're curious about as you interact with people. So maybe it's this thing where every single day as you talk to people, if you have a social topic, you might just bring up the same question over and over again and start looking for are there any differences or surprises in what people are telling you? One of the big reasons why I think curiosity loops are really useful is that it really fights the fact that there's a lot of bad advice out there.\n\n(00:05:54):\nAnd it's not bad because it's not well-intentioned, but it's bad because it's not contextual. So when someone tells you to quit your job and chase your dreams, or they tell you to sit tight and grind through and build some experience before you go off and go start the company that you've always been thinking about starting, which piece of advice do you actually take? Right? A lot of it depends on your situation, what you're considering, what skills and experience you actually have, and curiosity loops actually are this way of really thinking about how do you make your advice contextual. So I'll break it down a bit in terms of how I think about structuring it. So the first piece of a curiosity loop is really just thinking about asking a good question. In the time when I was working at SurveyMonkey in the past, I had this opportunity to spend a lot of time with the survey researchers, and we really talked a lot about what makes a question good.\n\n(00:06:44):\nSo in this case, a question's good if it's specific, if it solicits rationale, and it's not biased. You don't want to start a question with, here's what I think because people have this tendency to want to please you or to agree with you. So a good example... Well, let me start with a bad example of a question. A bad example of a question is, what should I do with my career next? It's just such a poorly formed question because it's really vague, it's not specific. It puts a lot of cognitive load on other people, and the output that you're going to get from it is probably going to be similarly bad. Garbage in, garbage out. A better example of a question might be something like, \"Hey, you know me. I'm a marketer. I've been thinking about doing this webdev thing. So my plan is to quit my job, do a webdev bootcamp and then go find a job elsewhere. Do you think that's a good idea?\"\n\n(00:07:45):\nThere's just so much rich data to actually explore with that. First, are you suited to being a developer? Are webdev boot camps effective? What's the state of the economy in the hiring market right now for junior web developers? And that's an example of maybe a question that's a little bit more specific and gives people something to anchor on. So that's the first piece. The next piece is really around how do you curate who you ask? I think there are two dimensions of this. The first one is the obvious one, which is a subject matter expert who really knows something about the topic at hand. So maybe a webdev themselves, for my example question. Another one, and this dimension I think is really important, is someone who knows you really well and can provide insight on how well does that work for you. And then after that, you really want to ask the question. And this touches on what you said about how do you make it really lightweight?\n\n(00:08:41):\nAsk the question in a way that really gets you a useful constructive answer, but doesn't put too much weight on people. So what I usually like to do is just make it very lightweight. So in your case, I said, \"Here are nine topics. Can you pick your top two and tell me why you like them?\" Some people went above and beyond and scrolled through and gave me feedback on every single topic. Some of them just said, \"Here are my top two, and here's one I think you should avoid.\" I wanted to design it in a way where if you're a busy founder, you're a busy product person, which is the list that I chose for this curiosity loop, you would be able to sit down on your couch at the end of the night, read this interesting email and tap out a quick reply and give me that answer. Because the risk that you're running is either you're getting poor answers or you're getting a really low response rate because you've given them way too much cognitive load in terms of answering it.\n\n(00:09:35):\nAnd then finally, to close the loop, I think a big piece of it is processing that information and then thanking them for it. So a big misconception that people have when they're really getting into this work of asking for advice or input from other people in the community is often that it's really one-sided. I'm asking you for help and you're getting nothing out of it. The reminder that I would have for all of you is that it feels really good to help someone. It feels really good to be heard and give input. And a big piece of that is, if someone comes to you and they said, \"You gave me this advice, it changed my life. Maybe it's not at that level, but it really affected my decision and here's how it turned out. Thank you so much.\" That feels so good, especially if you only spent a few minutes giving them the input that enabled them to make a better decision.\n\nLenny (00:10:21):\nSo to summarize, I wrote these pieces down. The concept broadly is if you want advice on a decision you're trying to make, pick some friends and this is... I guess I'll go through the four things you just mentioned. And part two is actually pick the right friends. But one is just, come up with a question that's specific. As in just like, what should I do with my life? But more, should I take the specific role at the specific company? Figure out the people that know you well and maybe have some context on this decision. How many people do you usually email for this sort of thing? What's a number?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:10:55):\nI would try to optimize for getting at least three or four responses. It just depends on the nature of the loop. And then you think about what is your response rate. So if you're emailing really busy people that you don't know very well, maybe you would assume that you only get half of people to respond. If you're emailing people really well and it's really lightweight like, yes or no, and here's why, then you might just send out a handful.\n\nLenny (00:11:22):\nOkay, awesome. So it's five to 10 people, broadly sounds like. Oh yeah, you want to make it really quick and easy. So it's like, here's 10 things, which of these two do you think I should focus on? So it's a quick ask as something you recommend, and then just thank them for it after you finish. Is that broadly the approach?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:11:39):\nYep, that's the approach. One thing I want to note is that it's actually really useful for personal things as well. So we framed it in this professional context of, I'm trying to change a job. But one example that I have is when we had our daughter who's now three years old, one of the debates that my partner and I were having was how do we actually set up our estate planning in terms of if, God forbids, something happened to both of us. How should she inherit the state? And my partner was basically saying, \"18 years old, she gets everything fully unlocked.\" I was saying, \"Oh, well maybe 25.\" And we're at this impasse. And we actually just started to tell each other, why don't we, in our day-to-day conversations with folks that we trust in our family, people that we think are smart, that have kids ask people what their perspective is on it.\n\n(00:12:28):\nOne thing was really telling, no one out of everyone we asked said 18. So that really dragged my partner up. And then the other thing that was really interesting was that we learned a little bit about executive function and the research around it. So executive function, which is your ability to make decisions and plans and be thoughtful peaks at the age of 30, and it's all downhill from there. So bad news for people like me that are older.\n\nLenny (00:12:54):\nAnd then I'm getting [inaudible 00:12:54] or game over.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:12:55):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:12:55):\nJust like I'm-\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:12:57):\nBut if you're thinking about 18, you are so far from your peak. So it dragged us both up in terms of what our set point was to make a decision like that. But we wouldn't have figured that out without a curiosity loop because it's too much work to dig through papers or research or whatever else to try to come to a good decision on it.\n\nLenny (00:13:14):\nSo the core lesson here is just, versus just emailing a bunch of people, asking for advice, which I imagine people often do, just what should I do here? Creating a little bit of the structure and even calling it a curiosity loop, I bet, helps people feel like they want to be a part of this and participate and help.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:13:31):\nYeah, definitely. One of the things that I always try to do is I try to explain to people in my ask, here's why I picked you. So for example, I picked you because I really trust you to be a sound source of truthful advice and give me some feedback. So I really value that. Do you mind spending a couple of minutes and just giving me some thoughts on this?\n\nLenny (00:13:53):\nAnd how often are you pinging people? If you're a friend of Ada, are you getting curiosity looped every week, or how often? What's your rate limit?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:14:02):\nI usually reserve it for bigger things. So probably quarterly or anything where I'm having a big debate, and I'm feeling really indecisive.\n\nLenny (00:14:12):\nAwesome. It also makes me think about this idea of a personal board of directors, and this feels like an asynchronous approach to that concept where instead of a call every, I don't know, quarter month with small group, it's asynchronous. Here's an ask I have-\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:14:24):\nTotally. Yep. I think this is really based off of the marketing concept of customer advisory councils. So when I was working in marketing and product at a startup, one of the things we would always have is a group of our top customers on DM, basically. And if we had really interesting product conflicts, we would actually just go ping a couple of them and ask them, \"Hey, we're debating this. Do you mind just giving us your quick thoughts and telling us why?\" And then being able to as a marketer come back to the product conversation and say, here is the literal voice of the customer and four or five different verbatims on what people think about this really enabled me as a marketer to have a seat at the table. And the insight and the helpfulness of that was really something I wanted to bring to my personal life as well.\n\nLenny (00:15:07):\nThat's really interesting. It's basically user research for your life. User research, you're told don't do what people tell you to do. I guess it's the same thing here, where it's just like, here's advice and then you end up making the decision for your own own life.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:15:19):\nRight. Right. Yes. That is the big caveat. Don't do what people tell you to do. Take it as an input and look for the hard feedback. Look for things that you strongly disagree with or are surprises to you. Because to me, I think these loops are more about looking around the corner and seeing if there's anything you missed in terms of the integrity of your decision making process.\n\nLenny (00:15:43):\nSweet. You said that people told you what we should not talk about. They're like, \"Don't cover this.\" What was in that list?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:15:50):\nSo I think there were two topics on the list. The first one, it was just how do you onboard and hire and bring people onto the team? And the feedback I got there was like, \"There's just so many people who have done this. I'm sure you have some interesting concepts, but I personally wouldn't be that interested in hearing it. And that was really useful to me. And then the other one was actually just about being a woman in Silicon Valley and the experience of that. I actually had someone write, and you probably read this, Lenny, \"No. Stay far away from this. There's no winning on this topic.\"\n\nLenny (00:16:23):\nOh, my God. Okay, let's touch on that topic rather than, it's going to be great.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:16:28):\nYeah. So let's ignore the advice?\n\nLenny (00:16:29):\nYeah, let's ignore it. Before we get to that, I wanted to first talk about you. You gave me some homework also ahead of this chat. And the homework was around helping me figure out values and personal values for myself. I did the exercise. So first of all, can you just maybe talk about what this exercise was, and what the goal of it is? And then I'll share what I come up with.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:16:51):\nSo the homework that I gave you is similar homework that I give to everyone that I work with in coaching, and it's this values exercise. It's this 10 to 15 minute exercise where you're presented with a list of words that might encompass potential values. It's pretty lightweight. You just go down the list, and you pick out all the words that resonate with you, and then we filter them down into groups of values, and then we filter them down into a stack rank and a list. And the output on the end is basically three to five sentences that cover what are the values stack rank that are important to you right now in your personal and professional life? And what I really like is, it's this internal scorecard of what really matters to you in your decision making process as opposed to the external scorecard of status, money, wealth, how other people perceive you, that often we feel really pressured by. So it's this great way to look back and see how well do decisions, or how well do my situations in life align with my values?\n\nLenny (00:17:53):\nSweet. And what I liked about it is, if someone were to be like, \"Hey, come up with your values.\" I'd be like, \"Oh, my God. I'm just sitting here thinking about words and concepts.\" And it was really helpful because it was basically multiple choice. Here's all the options across tons of categories, just keep picking and then helps you whittle them down. I ended up with six. I feel like that's one too many. Actually, I added a bonus one because it's just one that I really like. But should I read through what I came up with?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:18:18):\nYeah, that sounds great.\n\nLenny (00:18:19):\nSo here's what my values, I guess. Choose adventure, stay optimistic, treat others you want to be treated. Classic. Keep getting better, act generously. And added one that my grandma taught me back in the day that has stuck with me, that had nothing to do with this exercise, but I just wanted to have on this list, which is, first do what you need to do, and then do what you want.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:18:44):\nI love it. What a great list of values and what stands out to me from that list too, Lenny, is this idea of achievement or status or success. A lot of the things that we talk about publicly, what your LinkedIn feed might look like don't actually show up in your values. And it must reflect in some of the choices that you've made in your life.\n\nLenny (00:19:04):\nYes, I hope so.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:19:08):\nLet me ask you this. Let's try to apply some of the values in real time as an experiment.\n\nLenny (00:19:14):\nOh, boy.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:19:15):\nIf you think about a recent decision that you've had to make or a decision that you're facing coming up, can you share what that decision might be? And then let's try to apply the values to it to think about if you were living up to these values, what choice would you make and maybe some of the pressures you might feel to choose otherwise.\n\nLenny (00:19:37):\nSo an ongoing decision I have is I have all these opportunities of things I can be doing. Additional things I can be doing. The podcast, this actually was a good example of I never wanted to do a podcast because I really wanted to... Life is good. I was writing this newsletters, doing great, making a living, doing one great email a week. And I was like, \"Why would I do anything more? This is good.\" So I've constantly resisted, I resisted the podcast for two to three years, and then eventually succumbed. And it was a great decision in the end. But now, I have other things that I'm trying to not do, but they're always pushing into my mind space like, a book for example. Of course at one point, and I paused that just so I could have more time for the podcast. So I guess the decision is just like, what should I say yes to versus say no to?\n\n(00:20:26):\nI'm looking at my values a little bit, and one of them is choose adventure, which you would think would be just do stuff, just try stuff out. But I feel like maybe it's just a missing bullet point here of, I just want to do less. I'm trying to take on less and do less and cut out and-\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:20:44):\nThat's really interesting.\n\nLenny (00:20:44):\n... simplify. Yeah. Because there's just endless things I could be doing, and I want to spend time with my wife. And now, my new child is coming in a couple of months, if all goes well. So that's where my mind goes when you ask that.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:20:57):\nYeah. Yeah. And then maybe if you were to decompose adventure, what adventure actually means to you and you go into that word list, you might actually just find that some of these opportunities like writing a book, at some point, it doesn't feel like an adventure.\n\nLenny (00:21:13):\nRight. That's so true. The beginning of it is an adventure. And then that's such a good point because yeah, once you start a thing... Something I always say about this content creation life is like, it's easy to start. It's hard to keep it going, and it becomes just this treadmill of just, you have to keep creating awesome stuff basically for the rest of your life. I don't know how you get off the treadmill. Not that I'm complaining, but that's just a reality of this path. So that is such a good point that it becomes not adventurous very quickly. So that's really interesting.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:21:13):\nI love it.\n\nLenny (00:21:42):\nI guess the other thing is just, what's a cutoff? What am I... I do a bunch of angel investing and so I'm thinking about just stopping that for a while just so I get up more time with my new child and just carve out things that maybe aren't as essential.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:21:55):\nSo on the values exercise, I think what you've done a really good job of is just really delineating, here are some examples of choices that you have to make. I think that there are some points in our lives where writing a book, it just seems really obvious. It's good for your career. It's the next level in terms of where you go from the community, the newsletter, the podcast and getting to that next level. But where I think there is value is these lists of values can help ground us from those obvious decisions. So in my life, to share a mini example of this, there have been a lot of cases where the next obvious step for me might be to go an executive at a big company and to go chase the dream and continue on the latter climb of my career.\n\n(00:22:40):\nAs I've examined my own personal values, a big piece of it has really been around prioritizing relationships and really pursuing knowledge and growth on my own terms. And things like independence and autonomy have started to creep up over time, especially once I started a family. It became very clear to me that sometimes the external scorecard of what people think you should go do is very much an opposition of what I actually want to do. Even though it might be objectively better, depending on what scorecard you actually use, I would actually be less happy with some of those outcomes. So I think values are this really nice useful tool to think about how do you make better decisions again to maximize for your own alignment with life.\n\nLenny (00:23:23):\nThat's such an important point. It connects back to the course that I taught and then this potential book of, it just feels like an obvious thing I should do. It was great, but it just didn't bring me joy. And other things bring me more joy. So it was a really good reminder of just like, do I really want to be doing this, or is this just a thing that feels like a smart thing to do but maybe isn't for me psychologically? So I love just the reminder of coming back to values as a lens to decide if you want to do a thing versus just, what are people telling you? Smart or... Which just feels like the natural thing to do.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:24:00):\nYeah, and it's really self-aware of you too. I think too. Cut it off because you start realizing that you're doing this course, and it's not giving you energy or it's not quite the right thing. It's really hard to say no to things.\n\nLenny (00:24:12):\nIt is. It is.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:24:12):\nAnd I don't think we focus on that enough.\n\nLenny (00:24:14):\nYeah, I've learned how to do that better. I have all these auto templates of ways to say no in different ways. Actually, ChatGPT, somebody's tweeted this that it has all kinds of good suggestions. If you could ask it, how do I say no to my manager who wants me to prioritize a feature? And has all kinds of clever words to [inaudible 00:24:30].\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:24:30):\nOh. Yeah, that's a great use for it.\n\nLenny (00:24:32):\nThe other thing that I realized as we were going through this exercise that I imagine you find also is when you come up with an initial set of values, I was realizing I maybe another value of just keeping things simple, simplifying. And I imagine that's part of the process of narrowing in on what's important to you is you take this first pass and then you try to use it in making a decision and then you realize, oh, there's this other thing that's really important to me and that updates your values.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:24:57):\nYeah, I think you could definitely use that process to force yourself to make a stack ring and to be really clear, and also change it. Change it. It's yours. So change it over time as it suits you.\n\nLenny (00:25:08):\nAll right. It feels like there should be a curiosity loop AI bot with your values that you email, what should I do with this decision? And then it's like, oh, you think simplicity is great? You should not do this.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:25:20):\nThe next big idea.\n\nLenny (00:25:22):\nThere we go. Somebody build that. Okay, so it's funny we went into reverse interview, and then I have to asking questions again. So let's do this. You talked about your career and how you resisted these shiny object opportunities to focus on the thing that you were excited about and wanted to do. So maybe a couple questions there. One is just early career advice. You coach a lot of founders. You had a really in incredible career doing all kinds of interesting things. What have you learned about what works best for optimizing in your early career?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:25:55):\nMy early career was pretty wild. So I had a really fast run. Over the course of seven years, I went from my first job, which was basically this entry level sales job at Microsoft, working on Microsoft adCenter to SVP of marketing at SurveyMonkey, leading a global team. And when I reflect back on what works across my early career, it really comes down in a nutshell to this career concept of explore and exploit, which actually sounds dark now that I'm saying it out loud, but-\n\nLenny (00:26:27):\nYeah, sounds great. I love it.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:26:29):\nExplore and exploit, if you're familiar with it from growth background, is really just around what mode you're in. You're either in a mode of explorer where you have a bunch of unknowns and you're testing to see whether or not you like it, how well it works, whether or not it fits for you. Or you're exploiting, where you actually have found something that's really rich and really deep and then you're just trying to get more. And when I think about explore and exploit for early career, it's all about exploration. You really haven't experienced that much, but you're doing it with a thesis. You're doing it with that growth mindset where you have a hypothesis. So coming out of school, my first job was at Microsoft. I was at adCenter. The big thing I learned from the 367 days that I was there was that corporate life at that point in my career was just a little bit too slow-paced for me, and I was really hungry to go do something else.\n\n(00:27:19):\nBut I also learned quite a lot about marketing and advertising. And I had the suspicion that not only did I want to try something smaller, but I also wanted to try marketing. So I moved to this series a startup where I had to sample my desk on the first day called Mochi Media. And I was in a marketing role at a startup and had this great run there over three years, where I learned all kinds of things and even tried product at some point. What I learned from that experience was then I love marketing, games was pretty fun and being in a smaller team was really dynamic. It was this choice on, do I exploit and go deeper into the industry or do I explore more? I was 23 at the time, so I decided I have so little to lose, let me continue exploring. My big thesis was, let me try being a founder. So then I founded Connected, and Connected was this personal CRM that's a little bit like Clay.\n\n(00:28:14):\nIf you've seen Clay now recently, in terms of how do you do a better job of managing and building your professional and personal network and-\n\nLenny (00:28:20):\nYeah. It's a beautiful product.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:28:22):\nYeah, it's a beautiful product, much more beautiful than what we built at the time. It was such a great learning experience to discover what it was like to be a founder of a company and an entrepreneur. My personal learning out of all of those things was really just that I was continuously optimizing that I loved marketing. I loved being a founder. I really like small teams. There are pros and cons to this corporate life, where maybe things are really slow paced, but the scale is really important. So that was really what carried me through a lot of my early career. After Connected was acquired by LinkedIn, I moved into this exploit mode.\n\n(00:28:59):\nSo I was at LinkedIn for a period of time while I was investing, and I really wanted to be intentional about the time that I spent there in terms of how I wanted to exploit it. So unlike a traditional path where you're really focused on trying to get the biggest title, a big team, set yourself up to run a big org, my role at LinkedIn was really explicit. I even told my manager this when I first came in, \"I'm here to learn to be a better founder.\" So there were a lot of things when I started connected, which I didn't know how to do very well, I didn't understand growth. I was fair to middling at pricing. I really didn't understand how to build a subscriptions business and how to price it. So if I can make my LinkedIn experiences match to that, that would be a huge win for me independent of promotion, or compensation or a whole bunch of those things because the plan afterward is actually to go off and start another company.\n\n(00:29:53):\nSo I managed to get into this great role leading gross marketing for LinkedIn, working with their growth team from a hundred million to 200 million members, read every experiment brief that I could, spent a lot of time with the team, really understanding their process, and then shifted into the subscription side where I worked on LinkedIn subscriptions and ran their sales subscriptions business at scale through the online channel. And saw how all of those pieces and worked together from a financial planning and analysis stage to all of the optimizations that they did. It was just such a rare opportunity, but I wouldn't have gotten those opportunities if I just let them promote me or I followed a strategy where I was just focused on trying to get the biggest title.\n\n(00:30:35):\nInstead, I was focused on those learnings and those experiences. Ultimately, the fact that I was a startup founder. I had big company experience. I had growth experience, and I had subs experience. And I was a product marketer. That was actually the winning combination that caused SurveyMonkey to send me a LinkedIn InMail, start a conversation and ultimately bring me in as their head of marketing at the age of, I think I was 27 or 28 at the time. Because their rationale was, you have all these experiences that we really need and you don't have the management experience, but we have plenty of that. We're happy to teach that to you.\n\nLenny (00:31:10):\nI really like this framework. I've never heard it described this way. Explore and exploit connects a lot with what I always recommend which, early on, is to optimize for a variety of experience so that you can figure out where you actually have a good time and what you're interested in versus getting stuck on the first thing something. I don't know if you'll have an immediate answer to this, but I'm curious. Many people don't know how long to stick with something that maybe doesn't feel good but may lead to something. Like, someone may be in a job right now, or just like, \"I really don't like this job, but I feel like it'll lead to something great. And I don't want to give up too quickly.\" So I guess the question is, what are heuristics that tell you to stick it out and stick with something that you think will lead to something great versus hold the recording and get out?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:32:01):\nThat's a great question, and it's a really tough one that is contextual on the person that you are. So one of the things that I like to share is this idea of, it's a little gory, don't be the frog. So if you are familiar with the story of the frog, it's this idea of boiling the frog. So if you take a frog, and you throw in a pot of boiling water, it'll jump out. But if you take a frog and you put in a pot and you increase the temperature degree by degree by degree, the frog doesn't notice and before it knows, it's boiled alive. And how I apply this to your question to come back and circle back to it is that, it's really easy to be a victim of inertia. It's really easy for all of us to be the frog where there are little things that make us uncomfortable, and we sit with them or we think, \"Gosh, it'll get better. The next manager will get better. I'm always one conversation or one promotion away from getting to that next step.\"\n\n(00:33:02):\nBut you really have to be aware of your surroundings. You have to be aware of which way is the direction of the temperature of the water trending. That's what makes the advice really contextual. I really look at it from the lens of learning. What can I learn here, and how am I growing and developing? So there might be an argument for you to stay at a job for two decades. If it turns out that every single day you're being really challenged, you're learning new things, you're deriving a lot of meaningful enjoyment out of your work and you're this happy frog that's hanging out, realizing that things are good and the temperature is not rising. But there are also situations where you might encounter just some really hard walls, where you don't get along with the thesis of the company. You don't agree with the direction of the company that you're in.\n\n(00:33:53):\nThere are fundamental aspects of the role which are limiting to you or you're not learning a lot, frankly. I think that happens a lot, where you providing a lot of value and doing a good job at a company, but you might not be learning things that stretch you and grow you to achieve your ultimate goal. When you are aware of that learning, I think that's the point at which you have to say, \"How do I change that? How do I be an agent in my own career and make a difference in that?\" And it doesn't necessarily mean that the strategy is to quit your job and do something catastrophic, and then go do something else, take a course or sign up for something new. It might actually mean a proactive conversation with your manager or the leadership to say, \"I love what I'm doing here, and I would also like to learn a little bit more. And here's what I'm interested in.\"\n\n(00:34:44):\nAnd then try to find a way to either land the right projects. So in my case, it was really growth and subscriptions, that experience that I really wanted. Let's say, you hit a blank wall there, even take it as a gift of time, which is great. I'm not going to be able to get this from my company, but now that I have this extra time because I'm so optimized at this job, how am I going to choose to use that time? And it might be around building relationships with some of the key people at the company or learning something new on your own time that you can leverage in another way.\n\nLenny (00:35:17):\nI like that. Make the most of the time, even if it's not the best opportunity for you. Also love the frog boiling metaphor.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:35:23):\nLittle gory.\n\nLenny (00:35:24):\nNo, it's great. So I guess the lesson there is think about are you that frog being boiled right now and think ahead, is this going to be the end of the-\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:35:24):\nRight. Keep an eye on your environment and which way is it trending?\n\nLenny (00:35:35):\nYeah, the temperature on the thermostat in your office. The other thing this makes me think about is, it's so easy to get caught up in making your resume look amazing and continuing to just like, \"Oh, if I get this next role, my resume's going to look so great.\" And this other logo and this cool title and role. I find that just like, you do that long enough in your life, you end up... You retire, and then you die. Life is that resume. Right? That is your life, you're living, and there's not going to be a point at which you have to realize, okay, I've done all the things to make my resume. Also, I'm like, \"What do I actually want to do? Am I enjoying this?\" Because it'll never end. You're never going to end trying to make a better resume and a more awesome background for yourself. Do you experience that with yourself or other people you work with of just over optimizing to make an awesome series of roles and logos and then forgetting, do I actually enjoy any of this? What am I doing?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:36:31):\nI have experienced that personally a lot. I think that it may be a generational thing or it just may be my background, but having grown up with the Asian tiger parenting, it's very focused on logos or certain accomplishments or certain achievements like, going to an Ivy League school, working in a company that someone's heard of, being able to have a certain title. At a certain point, I bailed out a bit and I really started to think about who am I trying to please and optimize for? That values exercise that I had you do, Lenny, is actually a big piece of that. So I probably took it for the first time over a decade ago, at this point. I looked at those values and I said, \"Well, if I draw a straight line from where I am right now and just extend it forward and play the rest of the movie as it plays out, given the current plot line, how well does that optimize for those values?\"\n\n(00:37:27):\nThat's great. My parents might be happy about my resume or other people might look upon me in a certain way because I've managed these achievements, but in my day-to-day life, what really matters to me, what's really meaningful to me, only some of this stuff really matters. So getting very intentional about that and being clear about who your audience is as you navigate your career. I think it's a terrible outcome to wake up one day and be late career and feel trapped because you have a certain lifestyle or a certain expectations of the people around you that you have to go work this job, but then you look at yourself in the mirror and you're not happy going in there. I think that's a terrible trap that we should all try to avoid as we navigate our career paths and find the thing that's most optimal for us, which is usually a mix of career success, but also meaningfulness and alignment in the work that we're doing with our values.\n\nLenny (00:38:25):\nI love this topic. Thank you for sharing that. This episode is brought to you by Sprig. You already heard me talk about how Sprig helps you uncover blind spots in your product development process, allowing you to better understand why users take certain actions and how they feel about the experience. Just this week, they launched their brand new templates library, which you can find at sprig.com/templates. Which helps you plug and play proven playbooks for helping you identify and solve the biggest challenges facing product teams today. From how to optimize an existing feature to improving a conversion flow, to troubleshooting drop off. One of the questions I get most on this podcast and in my newsletter is how to develop your product sense. So I decided to work with Sprig to build a playbook for how to do just that, based on my experience at Airbnb and what I learned from interviewing top product people like, Jules Walter who wrote a whole guest post on how to develop your product sense, which informed this template that you'll find. Just go to sprig.com/templates to find this playbook and 85 more that is sprig.com/templates. S-P-R-I-G.com/plates.\n\n(00:39:31):\nWhat triggered your reevaluation of that path? Was there just like a, \"Oh, man. I need to really rethink where I'm going.\" And then I have a follow-up question.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:39:40):\nReally just a career opportunity. And it was this step where I could do something that was, at the time, really high profile and really exciting and felt great, but also involved demanding travel and grueling hours. And wasn't in a space that I was excited about, but it looked amazing on my resume. And I was talking to a friend about it, and they actually introduced me to this values exercise to say like, \"Ada, go through and fill out this values exercise, and apply it to this job.\" What I realized at the time, after I did it, was that my top three values, the things that I cared about this job would categorically just fail at because I would be gone all the time, in pursuit of glory that I didn't really care about. Instead, my current path at the time was something that if I persisted in, it would actually be able to potentially fulfill all of those values.\n\nLenny (00:40:36):\nIt reminds me of a friend who has this metaphor of this ego monster sitting in the corner of the room that's always yelling at them, when they're... To do the thing that's impressive and take on the really cool role, and just get an awesome title, and do something really impressive, that's just like yelling at them from the corner. And my friend's just learned to just like, \"Okay, that's the ego monster pulling at me. I don't have to listen to that. Doesn't mean I'm going to be happy if I listen to this guy.\" And that's been really helpful to my friend just to disassociate that part of the brain.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:41:10):\nYeah. The ego monster is a great way to put it. I use something that Warren Buffet has talked about, which is inner scorecard versus outer scorecard.\n\nLenny (00:41:19):\nTell me more.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:41:20):\nSo he talks about how there's an outer scorecard, which is how the rest of the world evaluates you, how you keep score in terms of external factors. So top 10 lists, wealth status, title, maybe things that people really care about. And then your inner scorecard is things that actually matter to you, how you spent your day, how good of a person you are. Did you have an adventure today, Lenny? Were you kind? And there are a lot of things that maybe are in opposition to each other. So really thinking about did you win at the cost of kindness? Did you succeed at the cost of losing access to the adventure that you really wanted? I think really thinking about it in that lens helps you trade off against some of that external pressure and the ego monster.\n\nLenny (00:42:11):\nThis might be a good segue to chat about coaching. I imagine a lot of people listening to this like, \"Yes, I want to do that. I want to measure myself according to my values and check in on this. And am I doing the wrong path?\" It's hard to do just on your own, I find. And I think that's one of the benefits of an executive coach. So maybe we just chat about what should people know about coaching and getting a coach, and does everyone need a coach and how to think about the idea of getting a coach at some point in their career.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:42:42):\nI'll have a hot take on this, and it's something that I share to people when I talk to them about coaching. But my hot take is that for the vast majority of people, they probably do not need a coach.\n\nLenny (00:42:52):\nGreat.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:42:54):\nAnd what I often push people on is if you're thinking about getting a coach, which is usually an indication that they have a feeling of being stuck or they have a problem that they're trying to solve, I ask them, \"What are your goals when it comes to coaching? Roll it forward six months, what have you gotten done in your coaching experience. What have you accomplished, and you're just... It's like, a home run. And then look at all of the potential alternatives in terms of how you could have spent your valuable time and often pricey fees to achieve the same goal, but maybe in a better way.\" The thing that people don't really think about is if you're looking for a mentor, a coach is actually a terrible mentor in some ways because it's this one person's opinion. It's actually way better to run a curiosity loop, for example, and get the benefit a couple different minds on a specific topic and hit their wheelhouse of things that they know about. Than to go ask one person, what do you think I should do in this situation?\n\n(00:43:58):\nIf you're trying to learn about a topic in a really robust way, let's say you want to learn about growth, maybe you should take are Reforge course and get access to all of the resources and the insights of the EIRs and the growth advisors that Reforge and get an overview and survey of the landscape instead of one person's experience and the handful of companies that they might have worked with. Likewise, if you're just feeling like you're a little emotionally overcome, I think coaches are this great resource around that, but it's actually better to pay it forward and build a tribe and a community of people around you that you can rely on for support because that's the thing that lasts you for years and years.\n\n(00:44:38):\nSo one of the first things that I do when people talk to me about coaching is I challenge them and say, \"Have you explored all of these other opportunities first, and do you really need a coach? And is a coach actually the best option for you?\" Like an anti sell, just so that they know what they're getting themselves into because I don't necessarily think that it's useful for all things, even though it can be helpful.\n\nLenny (00:44:59):\nAnd then when do you find that it's actually important and valuable and something someone should try to get?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:45:06):\nI wouldn't be a coach if I didn't think that it wasn't important and valuable. I think that in certain contexts it can be super helpful. So when you have situations where you're in a state of hyper growth, and you need very accelerated learning, and you need someone who can point you in the right direction, I think coaches can be really helpful. So I work with founders for example, and founders are just in this unique state where everything is chaos. They have no structure. They don't know what their jobs are. They have fully justified imposter syndrome where no one in their right mind would objectively have hired them for the position that they're in. There's really intense highs and lows. So for a founder, it might make a lot of sense to get a coach because they have to learn a lot of stuff really quickly, and time is of the essence.\n\n(00:45:54):\nSo a coach might be a really helpful shortcut for them to get there. Related to that, I think it's also really helpful on sensitive topics. So there are a lot of things that we want to be coached on where either it takes a lot of time for us to work through and progress because it's a long-term project, for example, or it's something very sensitive. People issues and interpersonal conflicts. Coaches can be especially helpful in those cases because it's this really safe space for you to work through things, but also have someone who's really rational to help guide you through them with potentially some frameworks and extra advice.\n\nLenny (00:46:30):\nSo I had a couple coaches in my career and what made me feel like I should pursue that is when you think about a sports athlete or, I don't know, athlete. No one does not have a coach, the best athletes have coaches and they get great because they have somebody helping them get better. It's not just like an accident. They don't just learn on their own. It just makes you realize that other people in their profession that have a coach helping them out are just going to be more successful because innately, they have someone helping them learn how to do the job better. So that made me realize, man, I should probably get a coach to help me out with stuff. Even though there wasn't anything super specific, I'm like, \"Oh, I need to fix this problem.\" It was just like, wow, this just intellectually make sense. So it was actually really important and transformative for me.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:47:21):\nIf you go to my site, I actually have this guide that I've written over time on both my take on how do you find a coach, and the TLDR there is actually that I strongly recommend to everyone. If you're thinking about getting a coach, talk to two or three different coaches. And really get a sense of their vibe and how well you get to know them. It's surprising because I did this piece of research, which I also wrote about, and we could link to, but I talked to over 80 people about their experiences with a coach. I talked including coaches, including founders, including executives and there's this shocking data point in there where half of people that founder their coach literally went with the first coach that they talked to. It's that your buddy said, \"I work with this great coach.\" And then you go and you hire your buddy's coach.\n\n(00:48:08):\nI think that's a totally fine way to go find a coach, but I would actually really just urge people to talk to a couple because what works for your friend may not work for you. And just being able to see some of the variance in terms of the style and how people get along, I think that can make a huge difference in terms of this reflection of how do you learn best? When you think about acquiring a new skill, do you love structure? Do you not like structure? Do you like it when someone really teaches you and walks you through specific examples, or do you frameworks? Coaches come in all of those different flavors. So I think it's really worth it to explore before you get into such a deep relationship with someone, just so that both people can feel really sure about it.\n\nLenny (00:48:51):\nWhat's one thing that people may not think about or just something that you find really important that maybe is unexpected when you're looking for a coach?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:49:00):\nI thought that credentials and the relevant experience of the coach was a huge factor in terms of how you should go about your coach selection. But part of the interviews that I did was talking to founders that had had experiences with coaches and asking them to reflect back, and these founders and executives when they thought about it, they actually said so much more about, it was actually this amorphous sense of vibe with the person, how safe you felt with them, how deeply you would explore with them, and how well they got you, and remembered the pieces of the conversation and help you put it together. Way more than potentially some experiences that they'd had, where this person had the perfect background, but they just never really connected on that level. So it was unintuitive to me that there was such a big piece of it that was around personal connection, which is why I've now pushed people to try to talk to a couple different people.\n\n(00:49:55):\nAnd then the other thing which comes back to the sports coaching analogy is that there are different coaches that are really good at different things. So just like how, if you're a star tennis player, you might actually have multiple coaches working with you, maybe an offensive coach or a defensive coach or working on a particular swing. It actually makes sense when you're really performing at a high level to consider having coaches that work with you on shorter term basis to really just work on your speaking or help you with getting into your groove on writing or help you achieve a specific goal. You shouldn't think about it as this long-term commitment to stay with one person, but instead more choosing off of a menu and thinking about what goal are you trying to achieve right now?\n\nLenny (00:50:39):\nDoes anyone ever get multiple executive coaches that... I like how we went from, you don't need a coach to maybe need a month [inaudible 00:50:46] hamstrings.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:50:48):\nYes. I know of multiple people that I've talked to, usually CEOs, that either have had a series of coaches or have multiple coaches. It makes a lot more sense, Lenny, when you think about someone who's getting a pitch coach because they're about to get into fundraising.\n\nLenny (00:51:04):\nGot it. Right. Niche skills.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:51:05):\nRight. For niche things because they're about to enter a process or someone who's trying to get into a writing coach-\n\nLenny (00:51:11):\nGot it. Yeah.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:51:13):\n... in addition to some of their executive and leadership work that they might be doing.\n\nLenny (00:51:17):\nOkay. That makes sense. I love it. I'm going to get four coaches. One for everything I do\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:51:23):\nA podcast coach.\n\nLenny (00:51:23):\nPodcast coach.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:51:25):\nA newsletter coach.\n\nLenny (00:51:26):\nA writing coach, and a-\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:51:30):\nYes. And then a parent coach. Don't forget that.\n\nLenny (00:51:30):\nParent coach. A job board coach, and then just a life coach. Okay. I'm on it. Okay. So let's touch on the thing that your friends said we shouldn't touch on, which is being a woman in leadership in Silicon Valley. I guess I'll just frame it simply. Imagine there's many young women listening to this podcast, and many may dream of a career like yours, all the things you've shared. What advice do you have for young women just starting out in their career hoping to find a similar path?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:52:03):\nThis is a really delicate subject, and it's interesting because when I try to decompose why people gave me the feedback they gave me on this topic, I think a big piece of it is just that you want to have respect for the inherent challenges of being a non stereotypically great fit for leadership roles or certain career success roles in Silicon Valley and acknowledge that. And also try to push for some of the agency of the things that you can do. So I'm going to start with just this quick story about someone that I worked with who's given me permission to share this, in a coaching context and then back out. So I was working with a seed stage founder, and she's so smart. She is really dynamic, very, very focused, really, really great at taking feedback and actioning it. She's one of those people that is just stellar, and I have no doubt that she's going to make a huge dent in the universe.\n\n(00:52:58):\nWe've been working together on Zoom for a couple of months, and I'd built this great respect for her competence as an operator, and the way that she thought and took apart problems and then acted on them. And then we met together for the first time in person at lunch. I feel almost nervous talking about this here. The disparity between my sense of who she was as an operator and how she came across to me initially at this lunch was really striking in that it was a weekday lunch and she was dressed as if she was hanging out on the weekend. So old T-shirt, hair back and in a claw, bra straps were showing. She was just incredibly casual in terms of her physical appearance. It took me almost like a little bit of a step back to reevaluate and think, \"Oh, this is the same person, but she actually just presents so differently.\n\n(00:53:54):\nSo then I took the step after we met and I gave her that feedback in one of our next coaching sessions where we invited each other to give each other feedback. I shared a lot of my impressions with her and I told her, \"I respect you so much as an operator. I want to tell you that in the physical meeting that we had together, there was this disparity on how I would've potentially perceived you when I first met you in person versus what I've come to know about you from the months that we spent together.\"\n\n(00:54:27):\nHer reaction was like, \"Oh my God, Ada. No one has ever connected the dots for me. Thank you so much. It has never explicitly been told to me that some of these elements which you describe, and they're very easy for me to fix and I'm motivated to fix them, are things that might actually trigger certain impressions or biases. No one's actually said it to me before, and I'm about to go into fundraising. It's actually super helpful for me to hear this, that these are controllable elements of my physical attire or my appearance that might actually just affect the way that people perceive me. And then it gives me this extra hump to get over, in terms of getting to this point of credibility for them to see me as a seasoned operator that I am.\" She took it so well. But what was interesting about it was actually that she'd made it all this way in her career. She'd even raised funding, and no one had ever given her this feedback.\n\n(00:55:21):\nSo this is, I think one of the big challenges of being a woman in Silicon Valley because getting to an executive role or getting to a funded founder role, it's like an Olympic level sport. You have to get all the way through the funnel and become one of the few that are really chosen to do that. But the difficulty of this game is that no one tells you the rules of the game. You actually don't really know what are the rules on how to get intros or give intros. What's the right way to follow up? What are the impressions that people have about you? It turns out that in a career context, it's so unsafe for your manager to turn to a young woman on the team and say, \"Here, let me give you feedback on your physical appearance, and how it affects your competence and how you're perceived in the workforce.\" That the vast majority of them will just never do it because there's no winning, which is similar to the feedback that I got.\n\n(00:56:16):\nSO where I lean in is to say, we're not powerless and there's something that all of us can do if we're in a position where we feel like not even about being female, it's about being perceived as too young or too old, too tall, too short, not the right race. Whatever reason that you feel people may be disqualifying you or not seeing you. We're not powerless, even though this game is rigged. We can study the game, we can help each other, and we can actually start to call out some of those rules and then find ways around them. In this case, for the founder in this example, she really turned to her friends and did a mini makeover and amped up her appearance.\n\n(00:57:03):\nAnd she came back and she reported, \"A lot of people have been giving me really positive feedback, that something about me feels more confident and more energetic, and they can't figure out why.\" But actually, she was getting a ton of people noticing that something was really different about her in a positive way simply because I was in this great position as her coach to give her some of these pieces of hard feedback that she had never heard before. So it's really on us to try to find those and then try to adapt ourselves to play that game if you want to play at that level.\n\nLenny (00:57:33):\nHow nervous were you giving her that feedback?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:57:37):\nI was so nervous. I actually almost didn't do it, and then took a deep breath and then decided, what the heck? I think she's great. I think she would really benefit from doing it and I gave it. Even in a position where I'm in a relationship with her where I can have that trust, it was super, super difficult. So I can only imagine how hard it is for people to give feedback like that in another context, but how else are people going to hear it?\n\nLenny (00:58:03):\nI think there was a company culture where they talk about how you're being selfish, not giving someone hard feedback because you don't want to be stressed or risk causing damage to your own reputation. But you're not helping them. So it's a really interesting insight of just like, don't be selfish. Do something that's hard when you think it's going to help someone else.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:58:26):\nRight. But I think on the topic of being female or on the topic of physical appearance or maybe even some of the topics around being an immigrant, if you're in a position where you can give that feedback, I think the struggle is often will it be well received? And that's where the feedback comes from me from the curiosity loop for this piece, which was there's almost no winning in doing it because the upside is something great happens for them. But there's just so many downsides to giving advice or giving someone input like that the default course is just to avoid. But then that person never learns the rules of the game.\n\nLenny (00:59:05):\nYeah, absolutely. It makes me think also a little bit about Radical Candor, basically. I don't know if you read that book, but\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:59:14):\nYeah, Kim Malone Scott, I think.\n\nLenny (00:59:16):\nYeah. And Sheryl Sandberg had a similar story where she... I think Sheryl Sandberg gave her a really hard feedback and she didn't take it that well, actually. I think you did a better job, or your friend actually took the feedback and did something with it. I think the whole book was just like, \"Hey, I actually do this where people actually listen.\" I think the framework is, you got to communicate that you care deeply about that person, but you want to challenge them directly also at the same time.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:59:40):\nYeah, it's a great story. I think Sheryl Sandberg took her aside after one of her meetings and basically told her that, \"If you say um, it makes me sound stupid.\" And she didn't take that well, but at the same time, later on in retrospect, she reflected that it was so brave and so helpful of someone like Sheryl to go give that feedback because there's a real cost to it. There's real risk to it.\n\nLenny (01:00:09):\nAny other thoughts or advice along these lines that you want to leave people with?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:00:13):\nThe biggest piece of advice that I have that comes to mind is really around trying to be really thoughtful on something I call eating your vegetables. So I have all these branded terms for things, but-\n\nLenny (01:00:13):\nThat's great.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:00:30):\n... eating your vegetables is really this idea around how little kids don't really develop an appreciation for vegetables until they're 10 or 12 exposures in. So the researchers say, \"Expose kids to vegetables 10 or 12 times, even if they don't like it, because that's what it takes to get someone to like something.\" So when I think about career strategy and when I think about improving yourself and I think about how do we look for some of the hard feedback, eating your vegetables is this really important component of it because it's about how do you identify dislike for something because you're bad at it or you're new to it or you've never done it before, compared to genuine dislike where you've done it and you really don't like it. So to make it a little bit real, if we think about the world of podcasts, Lenny, I think it's something like 75 or 80% of podcasts never make it past the first podcast.\n\n(01:01:25):\nYou have to do things a number of times before you really develop an affinity for it. Because the first time you do it, you're just not going to be good. So my mini example of that was early on in my career, I was really awkward and not very good at networking. I moved to Silicon Valley and one of the things that people told me about Silicon Valley was that it's really important to grow your network. It's all about the people. Totally agree about that. However, I didn't know anyone, and I didn't really understand this networking thing. So I gave myself this rule where I had to go out once a week for a couple of months, go to an external event, and I would count out 10 business cards. And the rule was, I had to hand out all 10 of those business cards by introducing myself to people that were new, and touch the back wall of the venue of that event and then I could leave.\n\n(01:02:15):\nI did that a couple of weeks in a row, and it was horrible. It was really awful, but it got a lot better. What I realized about that was actually two things. One that, as I started going and I saw familiar faces, it became a lot easier for me to just break in and meet people, just by seeing who people I knew already were talking to. And then second, I got a lot better at just breaking in and introducing myself and understanding how this intro and networking thing worked in terms of meeting people and moving through a crowd. Some of those relationships now from that first job and those first couple months are pretty much foundational to the network and the people that I know today. So it really paid off for me because I really focused on eating my vegetables and powering through that initial discomfort.\n\n(01:03:00):\nSo to title back when it comes to thinking about how do you progress in your career, think about the obvious things that maybe you're not very good at, and then think about what are some of the actions that you can do to be very deliberate and intentional about practicing it to get to the point where you have some faculty at it because it's just really important in some cases to be good at certain skills.\n\nLenny (01:03:24):\nI really like that. I also really like the physicality of that rule of touching the back wall. It just forces you to go through a room, and I just escape really quickly. Is there any other examples of things you've seen or recommend for doing things like, eating vegetables? That was a really good example of just forcing yourself to go to a networking event, touch the back wall. Is there anything else, any other examples that come to mind that you've recommended or found useful, doing something really hard that was really impactful?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:03:53):\nYeah. So there are actually a few of them. A lot of them around content creation because it's just so hard. So one of them that comes to mind is, I know a lot of people have talked about doing a LinkedIn 30. So 30 days of posting something on LinkedIn in terms of content every day for 30 days straight, and just getting past that barrier of sharing. And then looking at it over time and seeing out of the things that you posted, what really resonated. I also think it's helpful to start thinking about things like getting into DMs. Right. It takes a lot of work to think about, \"Oh, this person's really smart, let me DM them. Let me try to strike up a conversation because we're well out of the world of physical business cards. I don't think anyone has those anymore.\n\nLenny (01:04:34):\nNo.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:04:35):\nBut modern networking is finding people that are really interesting on the internet and then finding some way to connect with them. It takes a certain amount of extroversion in that case to start meeting up with people and having conversations with them. So forcing yourself in some way to really think about, \"Well, instead of having one outreach and then failing at it and saying, 'I'm never doing that again.' How do I actually create a pattern where I can learn or a sequence of trying to do this 10 or 12 times, and see what I get out of it?\" Because that's really how you learn and how you grow.\n\nLenny (01:05:07):\nThe LinkedIn 30 idea, I like a lot. Something that I'll share as a tip is when you hear that, I bet a lot of people are just like, \"Oh, my God. Going to link post on LinkedIn. So cringey. I don't want to be this self-promotiony LinkedIn person.\" But what I find is if you reframe it to, \"I just want to crystallize a thought that I have and just share something that is useful to me or an insight I've had, and not think of it from, I'm trying to get as many likes. I'm trying to go viral with this post, or I'm trying to just build some following.\" Just don't think of it that way. Think of it as just want to communicate a thought I have and use this opportunity to crystallize it in a really simple way. That helps motivate. That, at least, works for me. It also ends up being useful for me. It's not like I'm trying to grow some following as a result of that.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:05:59):\nI find that really helpful as well. One piece of advice that's similar to that that I've heard is, write for an audience of one. Imagine you're just talking to a friend or you're trying to talk to someone that's a trusted colleague, and just write for them. I think that's really helpful, and it helps us with the problem of getting in over your skis, really over fixating on the outcome of, I did a post and I didn't get my 5,000 followers. And instead, just thinking about I did a post because I wanted to share an interesting idea, and then how cool, some people resonated with it.\n\nLenny (01:06:31):\nYeah, I love that. You could just even say, something I found useful day one and just approach it that way. That's the stuff that end up being most interesting to people. The less it feels like you're trying to be thirsty for followers and likes and all that stuff. And the more it's just like, here's the thing I've found useful. Enjoy it, if you can.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:06:49):\nYeah. Yeah. People can really tell when you're being genuine and authentic online.\n\nLenny (01:06:53):\nAbsolutely. More and more. Maybe a last question. You started a company with your partner. You're both co-founders, you and your husband. I'm curious, what's your take on that approach to starting company? Would you recommend for other folks or not?f\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:07:10):\nIf you had asked me when I first started the company, it would've been an enthusiastic hell yes. I totally recommend. Now, I have a couple asterisks on top of it, and-\n\nLenny (01:07:10):\nGo on.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:07:23):\n... I think it really just goes back to what I was talking about earlier where being a founder is such a traumatic and crazy experience with all these intense highs and lows and lack of structure that when you throw romance into the mix, it's just this really volatile combination. So what I've found is that it seems like it either goes really well or it goes really badly, and there's no in between. And asterisks are there because we've actually had a couple of friends try it, and it's been such a mixed bag of results. So my personal experience is I love it. My partner Sachin, and I work really well together. And the main benefit that we have is that the active founding is such an active obsession that you spend so much of your time thinking about your business and the concepts of your business and whatever problem you happen to be facing.\n\n(01:08:11):\nThat when I had this thesis of I want to be a founder too, we played it out and said, \"Well, okay, now we're going to walk around being obsessed about two completely different things. We may never see each other, and so why not try the same thing?\" So our first experiment was actually trying it together, and we were nuts. I actually had a 30, 60 and 90 day plan where we would have check-ins. And some of the explicit questions in the check-in, is this affecting our relationship? Because I just wanted to make sure we were putting our relationship first. It worked well for us to the extent that we've done two companies together. And then when we were at LinkedIn, we actually moved across multiple teams in the company and continued to be counterparts and product and marketing together. So it's been phenomenal. The thing that I would say really helps us in terms of making it a successful relationship was things that I think apply to anyone that's thinking about, should you work with a person and should you be a co-founder with this person?\n\n(01:09:08):\nWe had a very, very good set of complimentary domains and skillsets, so we had really clear decision making rights. Sachin does product design and engineering. I focus on marketing, operations, finance, everything else on the business side. And because of that, it's really clear that we take input from each other, but ultimately who makes the call and who's driving and owning that project. So that was really helpful for us. And then the big part that I think is the murky Meyer for couples and maybe even for close friends working together is how do you engage in constructive conflict? How do you get to the point where you're attacking the problem and not each other? So if your partner comes to you and says that work was not good, that marketing plan or that product roadmap that you put together, not good, do you take it as the plan is not good and let's talk about what we can actually do to fix it?\n\n(01:10:06):\nOr do you take it as, \"Oh, gosh, they think I'm not good. They think I'm too lazy. I saw that look that they were giving me.\" And take it as this personal offense. So the ability to be really truth seeking and take the most respectful interpretation when you're giving feedback to focus on trying to get to a smart good outcome that benefits the business, I think that's actually one of the most crucial things that you have to think about. If you're going to work with anyone. Much less your partner or a close friend on starting a company and what's really worked for us,\n\nLenny (01:10:37):\nI am very impressed with how you're able to execute on this. I don't think I could do this with my wife. That would not go well, I think. You should probably write-\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:10:37):\nThat's self awareness.\n\nLenny (01:10:48):\nYeah. No, we're aware. You should write a post on how to successfully build a company with your partner. That seems like you have a lot of really interesting frameworks and insights on how it's worked. The fact that-\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:10:57):\nThat's a good idea.\n\nLenny (01:10:58):\n... [inaudible 01:10:58] for so long. Yeah, it could be its own little book. Is there anything else you wanted to share or touch on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:11:06):\nI think you covered most of it, Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:11:08):\nWith that then, we have reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:11:15):\nI am ready.\n\nLenny (01:11:17):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:11:20):\nPersuasion by Robert Cialdini. I think it's a great book, if you're a marketer. It's a great book, if you're a founder or product person. But it really is a breakdown of what are the different strategies to get people to say yes and help persuade them toward things. I think it really helps in terms of thinking through that and designing a product or a business around it.\n\nLenny (01:11:40):\nI've got that in my bookshelf behind me.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:11:43):\nOh, yeah. It's a great book. Yeah. The next book that I also recommend is a book called Designing Your Life, and it's out of the Stanford Design School. And it's by, let me look, Bill Burnett and Dave Evans. They're two Stanford D School professors, and what they're doing is they're applying design principles to life design. So how do you actually map that next level career that's both meaningful and fulfilling and also achieves maybe some of the success factors that you really care about, and brainstorm and be really creative about it. So when people are stuck or thinking about career strategy, that's actually one of the books that I always point out for them.\n\nLenny (01:12:23):\nWhat's a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:12:25):\nSo Ted Lasso is back, so I'm watching that, the newest season. I am also a Star Trek nerd, so I'm watching Star Trek: Strange New Worlds.\n\nLenny (01:12:25):\nI didn't know there's a new Star Trek. That's good to know.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:12:41):\nOh, It's so good. I think the thing I love about Star Trek is just that, unlike some of the classic storylines that you see right now on TV coming out now, sometimes the episodes are just happy. They explore a planet. Nothing bad happens. They see something really wondrous. They all leave happy, and they pat themselves on the back for having explored something. It's something that's missing in the genre of TV that they still have, this happiness factor where sometimes life is good and sometimes life is bad.\n\nLenny (01:13:09):\nI like the sound of that. Although, I've learned about storytelling for a story to be interesting. There needs to be some conflict or problem. So I imagine there's something going wrong somewhere in the middle.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:13:20):\nBut it's not wrong. It's something interesting happens.\n\nLenny (01:13:23):\nOh.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:13:23):\nAnd then it's resolved, and it's happy. Right. But it just doesn't always need to be, something tries to kill you.\n\nLenny (01:13:28):\nI got to watch that. That sounds great. I was a huge Star Trek fan back in the day. Didn't know they were still making new ones. What's a favorite interview question you like to ask when you're interviewing people?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:13:37):\nWhat's a common misconception people have about you? I usually like to throw that in toward the end of the interview, and the reason why I think it's really useful is it's a way for me to reset my bias. I may have had a certain impression about them, and this is their opportunity to speak up and say, \"Hey, a lot of people think this about me, but it's not true.\" It's also this reflection of their self-awareness.\n\nLenny (01:14:01):\nGreat. What are some products that you've recently discovered or use regularly, SaaS products or even consumer fun random products that you want to share?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:14:14):\nYeah. I can't go through this podcast without giving a shout-out to Notejoy. So Notejoy is a fast and focused notes app for individuals and teams. So that's the company that I work on. So I use it for everything from Noora product roadmaps to my coaching notes, to even prepping for something like this podcast. I use Notejoy all the time. Another one that I really use a lot is Captio. It's been around for a while, but it's a little iOS app. I don't know if it's on Android, but basically it's a blank notepad. You can dump your brain into it, and there's one button, and it emails it to you. So when I find that I'm really distracted, or I just want to remember something, I use Captio all the time just to quickly capture my ideas. And then I process it later in my inbox.\n\n(01:14:53):\nAnd then something that I just downloaded this week is Arc, the new browser. I'm actually really excited about its vision. I'm not sure if I'm going to work it into my workflow yet or how it fits in, but it's really beautiful and it's really cool to see someone iterating on the cluster that is browser tabs.\n\nLenny (01:15:11):\nYep. Love Arc. Went deep on Arc in the previous episode and I used Captio, however you call it. And I found another app, actually, the similar thing that I found even more simple. It's called Note to Self, just sits on my doc. Anytime I want to email myself a thought, I open it up and this type of thing. Somehow, it ends up being even easier. So that's another one to check out, Note to Self. Final question. You're really big on productivity. What's one tip that you found that has been really helpful for you in your day-to-day life, being more productive?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:15:43):\nFigure out, maybe the night before, the one thing that you want to get done in your day, and then at the earliest opportunity, just try to give yourself five minutes on it. Just five minutes. And the reason why I say five minutes is that there is this challenge that I experience and maybe other people experience as well, which is really just productive procrastination. Even though I know something is really important that needs to get done, I will often do other things that are useful and need to get done simply because I'm avoiding that one thing. And then before you know it's the end of the day and I'm like, \"I still have to go do that thing.\" By really focusing on what's the number one thing and then just getting started on it a little bit. It just makes it really lightweight. And usually, what I find is that five minutes turns into a solid hour just knocking that thing out early in my day, and I feel really accomplished. But it's a mental hurdle that I really struggle with.\n\nLenny (01:16:37):\nI really like the approach of the five minutes because that's such a trick to get you to like, \"All right, I'll just do five minutes. I got to get this done.\"\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:16:44):\nRight. It's quick.\n\nLenny (01:16:44):\nI need to bring it. Yeah. There's a book that many people on this podcast have recommended called Make Time, and there's a framework within that called The Highlight, where you pick the highlight of your day, and that's the thing you got to do first and make... That's like, if you do nothing else, do your highlight and-\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:16:59):\nYeah, really similar then.\n\nLenny (01:17:01):\nYeah, and they don't do the five-minute thing, so I think that's a clever element of it. Ada, this was amazing. This chat was full of feelings, and frogs, and vegetables, and frameworks and insights. Thank you again so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more, reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:17:21):\nYou can find me online. On Twitter and LinkedIn, I'm Ada Chen, A-D-A-C-H-E-N. I have a website, adachen.com, and you can always just shoot me an email, adachen@gmail.com. In terms of how listeners can be useful to me, any feedback and riffs on some of the ideas and topics that we've shared. I'm always eager to learn from other people. So feel free to drop a note and say hello. And if you're a founder and you're interested in learning more about coaching, I'm always happy to talk.\n\nLenny (01:17:51):\nAwesome. And then Notejoy, how do they check that out?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:17:54):\nNotejoy.com.\n\nLenny (01:17:56):\nSo easy. Great domain.

    "content": "Adam Fishman (00:00:00):\nOnboarding is the only part of your product experience that a hundred percent of people are ever going to touch. Good luck getting a hundred percent feature adoption of anything else in your product, right? But onboarding is the thing that you have to go through in order to use the product. It's also the first opportunity that you have as a company to deliver on the promise that you made out in the marketplace. So I like to think of your brand is the promise that you're making and your product experience is your delivery of that promise. And those two things have to be in lockstep with each other, or you're going to have mismatched expectations and some really disappointed customers. So this is the first chance that a customer has to be really excited or really disappointed in what they thought they were getting. So don't mess that up.\n\nLenny (00:00:55):\nAdam Fishman was the first growth and marketing hire at Lyft where he spent two and a half years leading their growth efforts. Then he went on to lead product and growth at Patreon, where he spent over four years building one of the most successful and lasting created platforms out there. And most recently, he was CPO at Imperfect Foods. Today he spends his time advising companies on product and growth, and he's also doing a lot more writing.\n\nLenny (00:01:19):\nAnd in this episode we cover three things, his growth competency model, which helps you hire and evaluate growth talent and also get a job as a growth person. We go deep into why onboarding is such an underappreciated growth lever and all of the impact that you can have optimizing your onboarding flow. Adam also shares a super cool framework for choosing which company to work at. Adam is hilarious and he's so full of wisdom and I can't wait for you to hear this episode. With that, I bring you Adam Fishman.\n\nLenny (00:01:50):\nThis episode is brought to you by Coda. Coda's an all-in one doc that combines the best of documents, spreadsheets, and apps in one place.

It's a pleasure to be on chatting with you today.\n\nLenny (00:04:36):\nIt's even more my pleasure. Thank you for being here. To set a little context for listeners that don't know too much about you yet, can you spend 45 seconds giving us a little overview of all of the wonderful things that you've done in your career?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:04:50):\nSure. I'm setting my timer for 45 seconds.\n\nLenny (00:04:53):\nAnd, start.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:04:55):\nSo I've been the Chief Product Officer and VP of Growth and Product at a bunch of different companies Imperfect Foods, Patreon, Lyft, the precursor to Lyft which was Zimride to name a few. Now, I do three things primarily, I'm an EIR at Reforge and a program partner, which means I create courses. I run an advisory practice on growth and product strategy, which keeps me pretty busy, and then I recently started a newsletter which was pretty much inspired by your work in this area over the last several years. Those are the three pillars of my life these days, my professional life at least.\n\nLenny (00:05:31):\nNailed it. Wow, that was very contained and clear. Let's plug the newsletter real quick. What's the URL? Is it fishmanafnewsletter.com?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:05:39):\nIt is fishmanafnewsletter.com. I am blessed with great initials that allow me to have that name for a newsletter.\n\nLenny (00:05:47):\nIt's not obvious. Adam Fishman AF. There you go. That's the acronym. And then in terms of the advising, just to set this expectation, are you looking for more clients or are you capped out? How should people think about that as they listen?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:05:58):\nWell, I'm pretty busy, but it is a bit of a revolving door, so there's always some pipeline. So even if I can't work with folks right now, sometimes it makes sense for me to work with them a few months down the road. So always open to new interest and learning about new companies.\n\nLenny (00:06:12):\nAll right, great. We'll share how to contact you at the end of this and it will be in the show notes.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:06:15):\nAwesome.\n\nLenny (00:06:17):\nOne question I wanted to ask off the bat is, Lyft, you were there super early. I imagine it was an incredibly wild ride. I'm curious, what's the most tangible memory you have of your time at Lyft?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:06:29):\nI have a ton of memories from the almost three years that I was there, but I think the biggest one, and probably the most tactile or memorable thing was when we launched Lyft, when we were bringing it out of private beta, we had this press event at the office, which is in Soma, and it had these doors, these big huge garage style doors. And so we opened them up and we actually drove a car into the office with a pink mustache on the front of it, and then a bunch of drivers piled out of it and met the press members and were high fiving people and stuff like that. And then we also served a giant pink mustache cake at this event. So of all of the things there, that one sticks in my head the most.\n\nLenny (00:07:14):\nI love that. I hope there was no hair in this mustache cake.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:07:18):\nNo, no, there was not. It was delicious.\n\nLenny (00:07:21):\nOkay, awesome. Another question I always have for folks that worked at Lyft or at Uber is how they feel about Super Pumped and what it is like watching that, if you've seen it, what it's like watching the story of Uber and especially working for Lyft.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:07:35):\nYeah, I have seen it. I actually read the book first. I've been a pretty big fan of Mike Isaac, who's the New York Times reporter who wrote it. So I've been a big fan of his reporting for a long time. I connected with him a bit while he was writing the book, and I would say, there were parts of it that were painful. It was like renavigating, relitigating a history that I had lived through already. And so much of that story was stuff that I had experienced pretty regularly while I was at Lyft battling against Uber.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:08:04):\nSo one part of me was like, \"I remember that. God, that was hard.\" Another part of me was happy to see that all of the things were out in the open finally, things that were hard to talk about about competitive practices and stuff like that and just shady things. And some part of me was happy that it was out there. And then one other thing separately, so I actually was interviewing with Joseph Gordon-Levitt to be an advisor with his company HitRecord while he was filming Super Bumped.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:08:35):\nAnd we had this conversation over Zoom when he was on break in between scenes of filming the show. And for those who don't know, he's the guy that plays Travis Kalanick, the CEO and founder of Uber. So he did this interview with me and he was in his trailer on set, fully decked out as TK in his look with his hair slicked back. And it was really funny and also cool to see him in this context. And he is probably the polar opposite from Travis Kalanick. Obviously they're both super successful, but JGL is a really down to earth, nice, very family-oriented calm guy. So anyways, this is a funny story of my time meeting and interviewing with him.\n\nLenny (00:09:19):\nThat is amazing. Did you slip in a couple Lyft facts to help Lyft look a little happier and better?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:09:26):\nI did. We talked a bit about that journey and I asked him some questions about how he prepared for the role and stuff like that. And so yeah, it was pretty fun. We swapped some stories and stuff. So yeah, it was neat.\n\nLenny (00:09:37):\nFun fact, my mom wanted me to dress like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and I was like, \"I should look like this guy. Wear some vests. This guy's looking good. Looks like you a little bit.\"\n\nAdam Fishman (00:09:48):\nI see that. I do see that. That's awesome. Way to go, mom.\n\nLenny (00:09:51):\nYeah. Then I'll follow her advice. Maybe I should have.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:09:54):\nIt didn't work out so well.\n\nLenny (00:09:56):\nYeah. Okay. So transitioning to the meat of our chat, there's three things I wanted to spend our time chatting about. One is your growth competency model, which essentially is this post you wrote recently that tells founders how to hire and how to evaluate growth people. Two, I want to chat about onboarding flows. You have a lot of really interesting experience optimizing onboarding flows and the impact that's had. And then three is how to choose a company to work out. You've chosen a lot of really interesting companies and you have some cool insights around how to think about that. Does that sound good?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:10:27):\nYeah, it sounds great. I've also chosen some bad companies in my time too, so we can talk about the good, the bad and the ugly.\n\nLenny (00:10:32):\nOkay, excited to hear about that. So first we talked about this briefly. You've started to do a lot more writing. You have this newsletter at fishmanafnewsletter.com, and you recently wrote this really epic piece called the Growth Competency Model, which essentially lays out what to look for in a growth leader, how to hire, how to evaluate, what to concentrate skills on? Things like that. First question, just what made you feel like you had to write this? What mistakes have you found founders make when hiring and evaluating growth leaders?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:10:59):\nYeah, so first I'm going to put up my new background here, which is my growth competency model background. For those watching on YouTube, I have a funny graphic in the background for this. So I guess the reason that I wrote this, there were a few reasons that I wrote it. One is it really felt necessary to write it. And at first it's, I don't think I've ever come across this type of canonical reference before around how to hire and plan for growth. So that's number one. I didn't think it existed. It needed to exist.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:11:32):\nTwo, as an advisor and someone who has held the head of growth role many times, I get asked this question a lot. I get asked all the time about how do you hire growth people? And it's usually something like, \"Hey, how do we find you but 10 years earlier in your career?\" And it feels like that question is missing the first principles approach to hiring a growth person. And if you're doing that, you're just pattern matching to me. And I may not be the best person, right, or somebody who looks like me may not be the best person. So I think we're missing that.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:12:09):\nAnd then third, one of the programs that I'm currently creating is around growth leadership. And so I've been thinking a lot about what it takes to be an exceptional growth leader, how you hire other people onto your team and create balanced teams. And this is going to be a really important component of that program. So it was just really top of mind. So yeah, that's why I wrote it.\n\nLenny (00:12:30):\nLet me ask one quick question and I think you were about to start answering one mistakes founders make, but I guess it's less of a question. I know this was built on another model for product management, which is really awesome. And I love that there's this growing fountain of career ladders, competencies per function. And so I don't know if there's been one that's really great for design and engineering, but I love that this is happening. And so first of all, I just want to say I appreciate that you put in the time to think this through.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:12:54):\nCool. Thank you. Yeah, and I do think we need more of these. I think we need one for marketers, I think we need one for engineers, designers, research probably, there's probably a bunch of functions that could benefit from some canonicalized resource around this stuff. So yeah, some myths and mistakes that I think founders made and that I've made. I've definitely lived through some mistakes. A few experiences where I was hired into a company where the founder had really messed up expectations of what a growth person should be doing, what I should be doing. And I wanted to set the record straight for founders because they are the folks who hire for this and other leaders.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:13:34):\nSo one example that comes to mind is, I did a very brief stint at a company called Wyzant, in between Lyft and Patreon. And the founders of that company, so Wyzant was a tutoring marketplace. It was acquired by a company not too long ago, so it's now part of a bigger learning company. And the founders of that company we're looking for what I would call a silver bullet strategy to their growth challenges. And what they really needed, and I was naive and didn't think about asking these questions or about evaluating this properly, what they really needed was to create a strategy to add on new growth loops and a system for how to execute against that strategy.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:14:13):\nIf we had talked about that as part of evaluating each other, as part of them evaluating me, it would've given me a lot of confidence that it was the right hire to make. But the problem was they didn't approach it that way. They didn't ask me those questions and I was too naive to recognize that, \"Hey, they're not actually evaluating this with the competencies that you would expect for a growth leader.\" Executing a growth strategy takes time and patience, and they didn't really have it. And overall it ended rather unsuccessfully. I helped them build this office in San Francisco, hired a bunch of folks, we actually closed down the office. I had to lay off a bunch of the people that I'd hired, including myself, which wasn't particularly fun. And I think all of it comes back to that they didn't have a really strong set of criteria on what it meant to hire a great growth person. And so if I can help even just a little bit with founders making that decision better, it'll lead to fewer mismatches I think in the hiring process.\n\nLenny (00:15:11):\nAwesome. Let's get into it. What are the components of this model? And you can put it back up again for folks to follow along in the background.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:15:18):\nIt's coming back.\n\nLenny (00:15:18):\nIt's like a TikTok.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:15:19):\nThe whole thing looks like a big circle and there's four wedges in that circle, four equal parts. And I think that answer of what are the components, what should people look for, really, I'll give the PM answer, which is it depends. And what does it depend on? It depends on the state of the team and where the skill gaps are. So the goal of the competency model is not to find a unicorn human being that is an 11 out of 10 on every one of these things, because frankly, that person doesn't exist. I am not an 11 out of 10 on these skills and I have been a growth executive at many companies. I consider myself to be pretty good at the job. The goal is to create a well-rounded team so that you're hiring and balancing skills across your team and that you don't have any gaps in your portfolio.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:16:06):\nAnd so when you think about it, there are four main components to the growth competency model. And the four big components or buckets are growth execution, customer knowledge, growth strategy, and then the last one is communication and influence. And each of those has three really specific skills. And so to give an example, let's break down growth execution for example, which is one of the very first ones that you should be good at if you're a growth practitioner. Within this competency grouping, there's three individual competencies that are channel fluency, experimentation, and what I'd call productizing learnings. And so you can evaluate and ask questions to understand how good people are at these different things and what their experience has been with them.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:16:54):\nSo in productizing learnings for example, one of the key things that a growth person has to do is generate hypotheses, learn from those hypotheses and then translate that into changes that they're making in the product. And you want to find somebody who has a track record of at least understanding how to take something they have learned that might be an experiment or something that's very NVP and turn that into something that has hooks into different areas of the product. And so that's a critical skill to evaluate. And one of an example, the overall set of competencies.\n\nLenny (00:17:26):\nTo throw in a question real quick, is one way to use this model, coming back to your Wyzant example where there's of course misalignment between you and the founder to sit down and look at this circle here and be like, \"Here's where I'm strong, here's where maybe we need to hire someone to take over.\"\n\nAdam Fishman (00:17:41):\nYeah, absolutely. You can almost use it as a reverse interviewing characteristic and say, \"What are the competencies you, founder, CEO, care about? What's really important to you for the first person in this role? Or the expectations that you have of what I will bring to the table.\" And then you can be really candid about what you're good at and what you're not good at, where you're developing. So yeah, I agree with that for sure.\n\nLenny (00:18:06):\nAwesome. I know this also plays into evaluating your performance and it could be like, \"Hey Adam, here's the three things that we want to focus on in the next cycle.\"\n\nAdam Fishman (00:18:13):\nFor sure. Yeah. It's really a good foundational framework for being really concrete and specific in the feedback that you provide someone. So rather than saying, \"Adam, you really need to be more strategic.\" Everybody's heard that at some point and it's like, \"Well, what do you mean?\" You can say, \"Hey, we need to work on the area of growth strategy and that means I need to see better modeling of loops out of you, better understanding communication of what those loops are.\" And you can give really concrete feedback.\n\nLenny (00:18:44):\nAwesome. So we've talked about growth execution, What's next?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:18:47):\nThe next one is what I would call customer knowledge. And within customer knowledge there's a set of things and really this is about data fluency and instrumentation, understanding user psychology, which is a big one, and then this idea of being able to experiment and learn over time and how you develop your narrative and your creative approach to talking to customers. I love user psychology and it's one of the things that I think attracted me to growth and to product. I studied consumer psychology when I was in college and I'm just probably would've been a psychologist if not for a growth practitioner, which is a weird other approach I could have taken in my career. But-\n\nLenny (00:19:35):\nIt's not too late to pivot.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:19:37):\n... Second career. Yeah, actually, announcing today I'm pivoting the newsletter to just talk about therapy and psychology.\n\nLenny (00:19:43):\nYes. This is going to be the title of the podcast.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:19:47):\nAwesome. So like user psychology, I think one of the things that people don't easily understand is that most people come to your product with an emotional frame and a lot of people want to appeal to their logical brain right away. And the reality is, don't do that. And so you have to understand the mindset that people are in. How low are their lows? How high are their highs? Why are they seeking out your product? And it often, as I mentioned, stems from some emotional challenge that they're having or something that they're seeking. And it's not because your product is the best chat bot or because it gives the best answers. There's a different thing that they're trying to solve. And only when you address that can you move on to those other things. So that's the second competency is, customer knowledge.\n\nLenny (00:20:34):\nIt reminds me of something I mentioned on some podcast recently, this tweet that one of the Collison brothers tweeted about how user research is often misunderstood in that people think you do user research and that informs what you build. And instead the way you think about it is user research informs your model of your customer and that model informs what you build.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:20:56):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:20:56):\nAnd the more user research you do, the more your model evolves to help you understand the customer. And that's been really helpful for me because I never thought of it that way.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:21:04):\nYeah. I think that's a great example. Seeking the solution in a customer interview is never going to work, right? You seek to understand and then you take that away and you can think through what the model should look like and how things should change as a result. Yeah. That's great. I can cover the third and fourth competency-\n\nLenny (00:21:24):\nThat's good.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:21:25):\n... and I'll try to be a little more brief on that.\n\nLenny (00:21:27):\nNo, no. It's good.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:21:28):\nThe third competency is growth strategy. And now the third and fourth competencies I would say are a bit more advanced topics. And again, remember when I said people index higher or lower on these as they go across their career, I would expect a more junior growth person to not necessarily be a 10 out of 10 on strategy and communication. These are things that you really have to work at a long time. They tend to be softer skills in a lot of cases and you learn best by either getting it very right or getting it very wrong. And so you've got to put in the time to develop these. But in growth strategy, there's three. The first one is growth loop modeling. So really understanding how you grow and where you should be spending your time. What acquires users? What retains them? What monetizes them?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:22:18):\nThe second one is capital allocation and forecasting. This is basically where are you deploying either your money, your people, how are you managing the portfolio and how are you projecting that out into the future? And that's a really hard one. You have to become best buddies with your finance friends in order to do that. And so anyways, that's capital allocation and forecasting. And then the third one is prioritization and road mapping. So you have to be able to sequence the work much like in building a product, right? Building your growth strategy, you have to sequence it. That sequence has to make sense based on your growth models. You have to have the capital or the people to allocate to that stuff. And you have to be able to build a series of hypotheses in a series of solutions to test against those hypotheses so that you can learn and then productize to those learnings.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:23:09):\nAnd there's a lot of ways to test this stuff. Situational, behavioral, interviewing, I talk a lot about this in my post on hiring growth. There's like very specific questions you can ask to understand what people have done or what they might do in different situations. There's case studies and things like that. So that's the third one. And then the fourth one is communication and influence.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:23:29):\nAnd I would say, I think you probably know this as a PM, influence is one of the biggest and hardest skills to develop. It's no different in a growth practitioner and in some cases it can even be harder because sometimes people come in with a preconceived notion of what growth is and isn't and you have to change their mind. And so within communication and influence, there's strategic communication. So how do a series of experiments and a series of things that you're trying, fit into the overall picture of a bigger bet that you're taking?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:24:06):\nHow do you lead a team? So team leadership is a big part of communication and influence. And then how do you manage stakeholders? And this is hard in growth because often growth can be viewed as at odds with really thoughtful and quality craftsmanship and product building, but it's not. Those things go hand in hand. And so you really have to win people over on what it means to do growth. And I would say, this is the pinnacle, right? This is the hardest one. It's a lifelong journey. It relies very extensively on understanding people and who you're talking to. And those people can be very different from company to company and the currency that they trade in can be really different. And so this one is one where you have to go back to square one and relearn who the people are that you're working with every time you step into a new role or a new company or get a new leader or something like that. So it can be really challenging and it's never done.\n\nLenny (00:25:03):\nThat component of the competency models, we're the PM of the growth PM role feels like if you were to do these Venn diagram of the two roles, feels like that's a big part of the overlap.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:25:13):\nYep, absolutely. There's a lot of overlap between exceptional product managers and exceptional growth practitioners. I think sometimes they just use the skills in different ways. So you need to be great at product strategy to be a product leader, you need to be great at growth strategy to be a growth leader. Just what those things look like can be different between the two. But they're both required skills, required competencies to be exceptional at the role.\n\nLenny (00:25:38):\nSo just to rehash, the four categories are communication influence, growth execution, customer knowledge and growth strategy. You mentioned earlier that people often come to you and they're like, \"How do we find another Adam?\" And your feedback is one, how do you know that's exactly what you need? And then two, find someone that's up and coming more because it's so hard to find folks like you that are actually ready to take on a head of growth role.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:26:03):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:26:03):\nSo a question for you is, one is, do you recommend founders focus on finding someone that's more up and coming and fast learning with a high trajectory? And if so, which of these components would you suggest they look for most?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:26:19):\nOne of the challenges of hiring a senior person is that they're all off writing newsletters and making podcast.\n\nLenny (00:26:25):\nRight.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:26:25):\nNot that we know anybody who does that or anything, but-\n\nLenny (00:26:28):\nNo. That's bullshit. What is that?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:26:29):\nYeah. So I don't want to right now go back and work at a company again. I'm enjoying what I'm doing and so it's hard to get me, right? But also you don't want me, I think, when you're doing this for the first time. So I think the key there is smart and driven people for sure. Age and youth is a bit relative I'd say. So I would think about hiring somebody who you might say is less experienced in growth, but they could be very senior in another aspect of their career. You can also benefit from hiring somebody internally who wants to branch out into growth. And one of the benefits that you get from that is a lot of time they have one of those competencies really nailed already. Could be like customer knowledge. They might understand your customer base super well because they're already inside the company.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:27:15):\nSo if you're going to hire a junior person, the key is, how do you help them learn? And I think if you don't know what you're doing as the founder or the leader, it's hard. You're not going to be able to help them yourself. So you've got to be willing to invest in advisors like me, outside education, mentorship, coaching, otherwise, what's going to happen is that very driven, hungry and enthusiastic person is going to run through a lot of brick walls, which is great, except they're going to miss the fact that the door was standing right next to the wall that they just ran through and you're going to end up with a lot of bricks on the ground.\n\nLenny (00:27:54):\nExcellent metaphor.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:27:56):\nYeah, thank you. And so I have some examples of both hiring people and moving people over in my career. So I think tangible examples are really helpful here. So when I was at Lyft, I had the privilege of hiring that young, smart and driven person a bunch of times, but one of the people who comes to mind is a guy named Ben Lauzier. You should have him on the podcast at some point. He's French, he's very nice to listen to you. He was most recently a VP of product at Thumbtack, but he was definitely not that when I hired him, he was a jack of all trades marketer working at a corporate catering startup when I hired him at Lyft. And he had nailed most of the growth execution and the customer knowledge competencies.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:28:38):\nOne was, he was an avid Lyft user himself, so he really understood the product really well. And also, he was just very thoughtful about how he executed, how he experimented. He had done a lot of it and he was very skilled at pulling them off in a very small environment because he had just had to be. And those are the two most important competencies when you're bringing in a younger, earlier stage person because teaching somebody how to execute is not that fun, right? That's a hard skill. The ability to execute is something like executive function skills and things like that. If you haven't developed those by the time you are an adult, I don't know that I'm going to be able to teach you and I'm certainly probably not the right person to teach you. You should definitely get some outside assistance with that. And so I like to get those types of people that have those things if I'm hiring that generally inexperienced growth practitioner.\n\nLenny (00:29:42):\nAnd the two things you said are customer knowledge and execution. Is that the two you said?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:29:46):\nYes. Customer knowledge and growth execution. And so let me tell you an execution story about Ben really quick. This comes also down to work ethic too. So we interviewed Ben and it was a long day of interviews in a tiny glass conference room and Lyft was, I don't know, 30 people or something at the time. At one of the interview breaks, Ben had come over and he didn't have his computer and anything like that. And so he was ducking out of work to do the interview. And he actually came out of the office and he's like, \"Hey, does anybody have a computer that I can borrow?\" And so we gave him this old crappy Chromebook and I was like, \"Why do you need a computer?\" And he's like, \"I have to go edit this file and do this thing and check something in at work and deploy this thing or whatever.\"\n\nAdam Fishman (00:30:32):\nAnd I'm like, \"Wow, this is a guy that really knows how to get stuff done and is so much so that he's pausing his interview process so that he could go get a thing done for his company that he's actively trying to leave, but he's got this work ethic and this execution.\" And that really stuck with me. And he probably would remember this story if we brought it up. So the time he borrowed a crappy Chromebook laptop to do work at the job that he was trying to leave.\n\nLenny (00:31:00):\nWhat are the chances that was staged?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:31:01):\nHe seemed very innocent. So I think not staged.\n\nLenny (00:31:06):\nOkay, great.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:31:06):\nBut I could be wrong. But now everyone that interviews that is going to ask to borrow a laptop and-\n\nLenny (00:31:10):\nThat's right.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:31:10):\n... check in some work.\n\nLenny (00:31:11):\nThe phone call.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:31:13):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:31:13):\n\"Adam, I need to fix something.\"\n\nAdam Fishman (00:31:15):\nThat's right. So that's Ben. And then on the other side, and I'll cover this one really quickly, and the other side of moving somebody over internally, I had equally great success with that. So there was another person named Sean at Patreon who was a marketer, again, a jack of all trades marketer. And I think I have a propensity and a bias towards folks like that because that's one of the ways that I started my career was in marketing. But anyways, I moved him over from marketing to being a growth PM, an entry level growth PM.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:31:47):\nAnd he had a ton of the execution skills, ability to prioritize really well and customer knowledge skills as well, more so on the customer side because he was an internal transfer, so he really knew our customers. He'd spent tons of time talking to people, studying data and things like that. And he had really great fluency with data and a drive to continue improving his ability to access and pull out insights and information. And so he turned out to be really great, but just a very different profile of a person than Ben was. And here's an internal hire versus an external hire.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:32:23):\nSo you can have success with both, but I think you really have to make sure that there's some foundational things that are in place like that ability to get customer knowledge and execute.\n\nLenny (00:32:34):\nIf a founder is listening and trying to decide or hiring a head of growth or a new growth person, would you push them one way or the other, internal hire versus finding someone up and coming and smart?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:32:44):\nI tend to skew more towards internal hire to be perfectly honest, because I believe in creating opportunity inside a company. I think it's not done often enough. And I also believe that helping people transition into new roles is a way to get more people into the practice. And one of the ways that can happen is if you take a chance on somebody who has demonstrated a good track record in some other aspect of your business. So I tend to recommend internal. I think you have faster time to results. I think you know what you're getting better and in much less likelihood of making the wrong hire there. So I bias towards internal hires.\n\nLenny (00:33:25):\nAwesome. And I think partly, I feel that too because there's so much content and training for growth these days that somebody has that background in your company and is already motivated and excited and then can just learn, go to Reforge course, read certain newsletters, feels like it's a lot easier to ramp up. Except, I always feel like if you need someone for SEO or paid growth, that's a hard thing to learn. What's your take there?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:33:51):\nI would bucket that type of person into a specialist. And one of the archetypes that I talk about is this idea of the painter versus the architect versus the surgeon. And the surgeon is your precision person. I don't actually recommend hiring that as your first hire, but when you are onto something and you really need expertise and you don't have that expertise internally, yes, I think hiring externally is the right thing to do at that point because those are really specific skills that some people have taken years to learn. And I can't just teach someone SEO over the course of a weekend and expect that they're really going to get it. In those cases, I think hiring that specialist or that surgeon is the right approach, once you've got some of the foundational stuff in place.\n\nLenny (00:34:41):\nAwesome. Great. Yeah, it feels like there's still a lot of dark art in those two specialties that take years of experience.\n\nLenny (00:34:49):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Tenfold and Cameo rely on Apple to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools, or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage.\n\nLenny (00:35:26):\nEppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics and instead, you turn north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions and payments. And Eppo supports test on the front end, the back end, email marketing and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, gete-p-p-o.com and 10x your experiment velocity.\n\nLenny (00:35:59):\nThis is a good time to segue to our second topic, which is onboarding. I know you're a big proponent of spending time on onboarding, optimizing onboarding. How have you found onboarding to be as a lever for growth and just what gets you excited about investing in onboarding?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:36:13):\nI love onboarding. I probably do at least an onboarding project to at least one with every company that I've worked for and a lot that I advise. The first thing I would say is, onboarding is the only part of your product experience that a hundred percent of people are ever going to touch. Good luck getting a hundred percent feature adoption of anything else in your product right? But onboarding is the thing that you have to go through in order to use the product. It's also the first opportunity that you have as a company to deliver on the promise that you made out in the marketplace.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:36:53):\nSo I like to think of your brand is the promise that you're making and your product experience is your delivery of that promise. And those two things have to be in lockstep with each other or you're going to have mismatched expectations and some really disappointed customers. So this is the first chance that a customer has to be really excited or really disappointed in what they thought they were getting. So don't mess that up.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:37:17):\nAnd the third thing I would say is it's also probably the most motivated that someone is going to be about your product since they're typically starting their onboarding journey with you at a time where they're like, \"I need this thing really badly that you're selling.\" And so they're really motivated, right? And so it's an opportunity for you to put some friction in place and learn a lot about them because they will knock down doors to get to your product. So that's why I think it's a super powerful lever for growth. And we worked on this extensively at Lyft, at Patreon, Wyzant, Imperfect Foods just released some onboarding improvements that we had created when I was there, which was nice to see that finally come to light. So yeah, I've done this pretty much everywhere at some point.\n\nLenny (00:38:07):\nWhat impact have you seen from working on onboarding to give people a sense of like, \"Wow, this is what I can get if I put some time here.\"\n\nAdam Fishman (00:38:15):\nYeah. One of the things that onboarding really drives is habit formation with the product, which leads to retention. And so you should expect to improve your overall cohort retention curves by focusing on the onboarding and activation experience. I have seen companies shift their curve outward by 10, 15, 20 percentage points from making those changes, especially when you consider that churn is most likely to happen in the very earliest usage of the product. If you can get people past that hump, it's a really invaluable part of the product to work on.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:38:51):\nSo I'll give you a really concrete example. At Patreon, one of the places we worked on onboarding really extensively and the onboarding experience was one of the teams that we had on growth at Patreon. We did a lot of experimentation around the earliest, what we would call product led sales now, when do you connect a human being with a creator and the onboarding experience and what is that impact and how do you connect them with the right person or with the right creator when there are tens of thousands going through that onboarding journey every week?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:39:25):\nWhat we realized through a lot of experimentation was the idea of connecting someone with a human being the right person at the right time would improve the first month of revenue or the second month of revenue that a creator made on the platform by 25%. Why that mattered is because the second month that you processed payments on the platform was a key input into your LTV on the platform. So by improving a creator's first and second month revenue by 25%, we were then able to improve their overall value on Patreon by an equivalent amount, which is pretty massive. Moving anything by 25% is really impressive.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:40:09):\nAnd so that was human intervention, and then we actually started to productize the stuff that the humans were doing. And so what is not scalable when you're using people becomes very scalable if you can replicate components of that with technology. And so that was the next phase, so we get back to that growth execution thing that I talked about and productizing learnings. That is an example of how you go from, we've learned some things by humans that have made a 25% impact to now we're building these into the product. And so that's a really good example I think, of Patreon and one of the impacts that we had on creator, earnings, retention and their overall success on the platform.\n\nLenny (00:40:50):\nThat's an amazing example, in case it's useful to a person working on the onboarding. Can you share any more about what you actually did there? You create some algorithm of this type of person, we'll connect them to a person and then you productize it. Is there anything more you could share there that might be useful to folks?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:41:06):\nGosh, we did so much. So I'll try to pull out a couple of example. So one of the things that we did, and again, I spoke to the fact that people are really motivated in your onboarding experience, one of the first things we did was we tried to identify better who a creator was in the onboarding experience. And who they were meant how big is their audience on a bunch of the channels where they managed communities, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Discord, YouTube, et cetera. And then how engaged was that audience? It's one thing if you make crazy cat videos on YouTube and you have a million subscribers, it's another thing if every time you publish a video, all million of those people watch it, comment on it, share it, et cetera.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:41:49):\nAnd so we would ask creators to connect various accounts to Patreon, maybe through authoring with YouTube or Spotify or Instagram or Facebook or something like that, Twitter, and then we would pull in the data into our backend and identify people who had large followings and also heavily engaged followings, based on a set of criteria per channel. And again, this was not just like me inventing this. We had a data scientist team that we worked very closely with to figure out what was important and what wasn't in this model. And then if you were one of those people that had a high propensity for success, high potential creators, we would siphon them off from the regular self-guided onboarding and basically land them in the lap of a human being who could engage with them, reach out, get them even more excited and start talking to them about the best things to do.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:42:46):\nAnd then the productization of that, the best things to do turned out to be things like one of our product principles, which became opinionated defaults, which is basically making it hard to do the wrong thing when you're setting up your Patreon page and easy to do the right thing but not eliminating choice.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:43:07):\nSo the creator could still make the choice to do the wrong thing. They could still set up a single tier when we knew that a three-tiered pricing model actually would work better for them, or they could choose to set up 40 tiers when we knew that the sweet spot was three to five or perhaps make their lowest price tier a dollar instead of what we recommended, which was like three or $5 entry points. So they could do all that stuff, but we made it difficult for them to do it. We put more friction in place when they were trying to change some of those defaults because we had learned across a universe of creators, hundreds of thousands of people what worked best.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:43:52):\nAnd so putting in those guardrails and those default things was a huge lever for us to drive the behavior that we wanted. And again, we learned that from human intervention with the right types of creators, then detecting those people and putting in the guardrails in the product themselves and making those recommendations inside the product experience. And they were pricing tier structure, how you actually write your page, all of that stuff.\n\nLenny (00:44:18):\nSuch a great example. It reminds me we had exactly the same situation at Airbnb that you just made me think about. We called it smart defaults. What was your term? Opinionated defaults?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:44:29):\nOpinionated defaults. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:44:30):\nYeah, I like that. So at Airbnb we had a bunch of calendar settings when a host signs up, on the host side is where I spent a lot of my time, we had instant book, which is basically you sign up as a host and people can book you instantly. That became the default for Airbnb. And so to make that successful, hosts had to have their calendar be accurate from the beginning. And so what we got to eventually, is we tried to figure out, are you a professional host that knows what you're doing? Are you a mom and pop that's just trying this out? And then based on that, either block your entire calendar, keep it all open, or somewhere in between.\n\nLenny (00:45:03):\nAnd it's interesting that it connects to your point about, and I was going to come back to this that, a lot of people think of onboarding as a conversion opportunity and it definitely is. But to your point, even more interestingly, it's a retention opportunity because in the Airbnb case, hosts sign up, they get booked for a day, they don't want to host, they're like, \"Shit, what the hell's going on here? I'm out.\"\n\nAdam Fishman (00:45:22):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:45:22):\nAnd so, I wanted to ask you, how should folks think about onboarding conversion versus retention, and why is it so powerful for retention?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:45:32):\nI actually think if you're doing it right, sometimes conversion should actually decrease a little bit. So you might actually have fewer people getting all the way through successfully, but I think that's okay because a lot of those people were probably not the right people for your product, which means they wouldn't have been engaged customers, they probably would have churned. So just by the nature of actually weeding out some people, you're going to improve retention because the people who are going through are the people who are much more highly qualified. And so I think that's also why onboarding is so challenging because you have to figure out what that sweet spot is, right?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:46:17):\nYou could actually reduce conversion to a point where it's not offset by improvements in retention and you'd be doing the wrong thing. So when you're experimenting, you have to look at these push and pull metrics of these opposing metrics. But overall, I find that the biggest impact that you'll have is on retaining users because you are trying to connect them to the value that your product offers and form a habit. And if you form that habit early on, they're going to stick around because they're going to get it, they're going to get the benefit of the product, and they're going to be excited to stay and then tell more people about it. So that's why I think it's a much bigger impact on retention than conversion.\n\nLenny (00:47:01):\nObviously retention is a longer tail metric and conversion is immediate.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:47:06):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:47:07):\nDo you have any tips for folks that are like, \"Oh my God, how do I know if this conversion hit is worth retention increasing potentially?\"\n\nAdam Fishman (00:47:13):\nYeah. I think the answer is not wait 90 days to find out, right? Nobody has that time. And so what I tend to do is look at proxy metrics. So there are proxies for things like 90 day retention. As an example at Patreon, one of our proxies around the eventual success of a creator was how quickly they would reach certain dollar thresholds once they launched. And so your velocity to get to your first patron, your first a hundred dollars processed on the platform and that thing had a lot to do with how big and successful you would be, and therefore how well you would retain.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:47:52):\nAnd so we looked at very early signals to understand and evaluate how good someone was going to be. We also did a lot of qualitative screening in the beginning. So as people went through, we would take samplings of creators who were onboarding and signing up and launching their pages, and we would actually look at who the creator was and what they were doing. And then we would be able to run it through our model to say, \"It looks like we're getting a lot of the right people going through and doing the right behaviors, therefore, we're very confident that they're going to retain better and do the right things.\" So yeah, proxy metrics are the key there.\n\nLenny (00:48:32):\nAwesome. So part of this is find this leading indicator proxy metric, and then to your point, maybe build a little bit of a heuristic that's like, okay, this is qualitatively looking like it's doing the right things to our new users.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:48:45):\nYep.\n\nLenny (00:48:46):\nMaybe our last question on onboarding is, at Airbnb and I imagine many companies, there's this constant desire to, \"Let's just redo this whole thing. Let's just redesign it. Let's start again.\" And my question to you is just, how much is too much on redoing, rethinking, onboarding, optimizing, micro-optimizing? Any answers there?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:49:05):\nYeah. I would say first, I very strongly dislike the idea of redesigning something for redesigning sake. So I think that it is true that you should spend a lot of time on onboarding, and you should regularly revisit it as you learn new things about your users. So even at Patreon, we would work on onboarding and then we take a beat, we'd let it go for a while, improved, and then as we learn new things, we would find ways to fold those back into onboarding. So I find that it's acceptable to revisit when you are learning net new principles about your customers or something new about your growth model where onboarding can directly influence.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:49:51):\nSo as we learned at Patreon what the right tier construction was, or the right way to talk about your Patreon page or the right way to message it in the beginning, we would go back and say, \"How do we build this newfound knowledge into an experience that sets someone up for success?\" But if we weren't gaining new insights, we weren't just tweaking the onboarding experience and trying to tune it in a very micro way, because the reality is, that doesn't really move the needle that often, especially once you've got it in a pretty good foundational place. And only when you discover something really fundamentally net new, will it have an outsized impact on retention or the success of early users. So don't just redesign for redesign sake, make sure there's a new hard earned insight that you've got before you do it.\n\nLenny (00:50:50):\nDo you think at scale companies, I don't know, maybe after hundreds of people, they should have a team, like an onboarding optimization team? I find that often is true. And I guess, do you think that makes sense?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:51:03):\nYeah. I think it's very helpful. And the reason I think it's helpful is because I do think it's easy to walk away from onboarding because there's so many other things to work on and to lose sight of the fact this is such a critical part of the experience. And I don't know how many times I've come into a company and they're like, \"Yeah, we built that a long time ago and we've never looked at it again. It's been a few years, but we're really having a real problem with retention and people dropping off in the first seven days.\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, I think it's time we take another look at the onboarding experience. Products change quite a bit. Maybe people are getting something that's different than they expect, or maybe we know a lot more that we can use to influence decisions that they make.\"\n\nAdam Fishman (00:51:50):\nSo I do think it is beneficial to have that team, or at least a team, that part of their job is the activation experience and therefore some part of their roadmap is working on onboarding and then other aspects of activation. So it may not be what they work on 12 months out of the year, but maybe for a quarter or two in a given year.\n\nLenny (00:52:13):\nCool. And there's a LinkedIn post you wrote with a bunch of examples of onboarding work you've done. So we're going to include them in the show notes for folks that are-\n\nAdam Fishman (00:52:20):\nNice.\n\nLenny (00:52:20):\n... hoping for more examples. Yeah. Okay. Third topic, final topic is around company selection and evaluating where to work. And you have this really cool framework that I think you call PMF for candidates. Can you talk about what that is and then we'll get into it a little bit?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:52:34):\nYeah. I somehow stumbled on that name and it just made sense because of the acronym. But I think I was really motivated to revisit this because as we know in tech there's been a ton of layoffs and very public layoffs because of the economy, the state of funding, things like that. And I don't think we're done yet. I think we're pretty far from being done. But it's really important, and I've been burned by this a few times, to put some power back in the hands of the people who are actually seeking the jobs to understand what are some criteria that are important and these are the criteria that are important to me that help you make decisions about which company I should join, assuming they'll have me. And so the PMF acronym, and we're all familiar with product-market fit, right?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:53:23):\nSo in a way it's both the product-market fit for as a candidate with the company, but then also PMF stands for people, mission and financials. And these are my three criteria. They may not be yours, Lenny, or they might not be the average person on the street, but the point is that you should have a set of criteria that you are unapologetically rigorous around and you should learn how to evaluate companies against that set of criteria. First, I guess I'll tell you what by people, mission and financials.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:53:56):\nSo people are these folks that I am going to enjoy working with everyday that I'm going to be able to have hard conversations with, that I'm going to be able to disagree with and work through those disagreements and feel better on the other side of that productive disagreement, for example, and get to resolutions. What do I think about my peer set, the leaders, the people below me, if that's the role I'm stepping into, et cetera. So that's the people dimension.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:54:30):\nMission, which is critically important for me, is that if I join a company and I do my job, which often involves growing that company really big, getting a lot of customers, generating a lot of demand and retention and stuff, I want to make sure that a lot of people have a better outcome in life because of that company's existence. And I don't just mean employees and founders having a good financial outcome, which I think is important. But I also mean in the case of creators on Patreon, we were building a new way for creators to make money, which they could then use to hire people, create more jobs, make better content, and live their life in a sustainable way so that they weren't a starving artist and they weren't living paycheck to paycheck. So that's really important, the mission aspect, that's got to exist.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:55:19):\nAnd then the third one is, and I think really important now is this idea of financials or fiscal discipline. You've got a lot of companies who raised boatloads of money or did financial planning during the peak of the pandemic and assumed that their business was going to continue operating at the pace that it was operating forever. A lot of those companies are running out of money, they've seen a hit to demand and they've had to lay people off as a result or make really big strategic swings.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:55:53):\nThere are plenty of companies that you're not really hearing about that were more conservative in their approach, that understood and were able to look into the future and be really responsible with their money. And those people are not laying off employees. And so they're not all over LinkedIn talking about it because they're not laying people off. There's no hashtag layoff for them. So that's what by financials. And so that's the PMF framework and evaluating across those dimensions is super important. I've done it two times in the last 10 to 15 years, and I've done it poorly, two times in the last 15 years. And Lyft and Patreon are two times where I've done it really well. Wyzant and Imperfect Foods are two times where I personally don't think I've done a good enough job evaluating.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:56:41):\nAny time where I've shortcutted my criteria, where I've settled for two out of three, or thought one was great, when really it wasn't, has not ended well for me, for the company, it's not that the company imploded, but I found myself out of a job or really frustrated and burned out or something like that. I already talked about the Wyzant example where we had to lay off a bunch of people because the founders expected something very different than what I expected to be able to deliver, that's a big people miss. And Imperfect Foods was somewhat similar, amazing mission, really great financial strategy, fantastic CFO, but a lot of infighting at the C-suite. And it made it really difficult for us to plan and move the company forward together because people were at odds with each other all the time and not resolving disagreements productively. And when that happens, it's hard to be a product or a growth leader because you bear the brunt of the angst that people have. So anyway, so those are a couple examples and some of the characteristics of PMF.\n\nLenny (00:57:57):\nIn the case of Imperfect Foods, what could you have done to have avoided that issue and seen if it was true PMF?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:58:04):\nI would have tried to observe the inner workings of the C-Suite a little bit more closely before I accepted an offer to join the company. I would've attended an executive meeting or joined them on an offsite. And I think, too often, candidates don't feel like they can ask for those things. And it's true, if you're entering the C-suite, you're going to ask for more stuff, you're more experienced. But I also think that's true of a junior employee. You can observe a team meeting, you can observe a product review and understand, you sign an NDA, you promise you won't tell anybody about it, but observe what is happening and the dynamics of that room. Who's doing the talking? How feedback is delivered, is it constructive? Is it antagonistic, et cetera. So you can observe and then you can also ask questions.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:59:00):\nSo questions that I like to ask are, tell me about the last strategic offsite that you had as a leadership team. Where do people disagree? What was one thing that they disagreed on and where did you end up on that point and how did you get there? And I actually ask them to tell me, it's like a reverse behavioral interview question. I ask them to tell me how they navigated it, and I will ask the CEO that and really dig in on that particular set of questions. Those are the things that I do to evaluate the people dimension, which is one of the hardest, I will say. Financials and mission a little easier to evaluate, but people really require getting to know teams. So it is hard.\n\nLenny (00:59:43):\nThat's such a good question to ask. And your point is you can ask that even if you're not a senior leader, you're just ICPM joining a team. Is there anything else you think folks can do? So you said, join some offsites maybe, ask this question that you shared, any other tips for folks just to understand if the people are a good fit? Because it's pretty wild. You're going to spend so much time with these people and you meet them once in a half hour interview and then you have to decide if that's your life for the next four or five, 10 years.\n\nAdam Fishman (01:00:09):\nWell, one thing that I would say is, you're an investor, right? You invest in a lot of companies, you're an angel investor and you have the Airbnb syndicate and things like that. You evaluate companies when you're making an investment decision, right? Because you're investing a sum of money into that company. And so as a result, you do a lot of diligence on companies or read other people's diligence, something like that. When you're interviewing at a company, you are actually investing an even more scarce resource. You're investing your time. There is no way to get more time. We're all on a finite clock. You can always get more money. If you make a bad investment decision, \"Okay, we lost there.\" Provided you didn't bankrupt yourself. Even if you did, you can climb out of bankruptcy. There are things that you can do, but time is fleeting.\n\nAdam Fishman (01:00:56):\nAnd so one of the other things, and this is a thing that you do when you're an investor, is you do back channel references, right? A company is going to back channel, you the employee, if they're a good company, they're going to talk, if you and I had worked together, Lenny, they might say, \"Hey, let me get in touch with Lenny and see what it was really like working with Adam instead of what Adam tells me in the interview process.\" And you're going to do this as an investor in a company. \"Let me talk to some people who passed on investing in this company. What did they see that I don't see?\"\n\nAdam Fishman (01:01:29):\nAnd so in this case, you can talk to current or former employees who are not on the interview circuit. And because they are not on the interview circuit, their role as a salesperson in the process is greatly diminished. And they can, especially if they're not at the company anymore, give you some pretty candid feedback on what it's like to work there. So I'll give you a really good example. That was super impressive. A PM who worked for me at Patreon, who you know Tal Raviv-\n\nLenny (01:02:00):\nShout out Tal.\n\nAdam Fishman (01:02:01):\nShout out to Tal, who works on this product that we're recording on right now-\n\nLenny (01:02:06):\nShout out Riverside.\n\nAdam Fishman (01:02:08):\n... when he interviewed at Patreon, he asked me for a list of people who I had managed in the past, and he contacted them to talk to them about what it was like to work for me. That was the first time that had actually ever happened in my career. And I was happy to share that with him. And it represented to me a great level of thoughtfulness and insight around him evaluating what he was getting himself into. And he was an ICPM and he asked that of me, who was a VP executive level person at the company.\n\nAdam Fishman (01:02:44):\nSo you can do that. And if a company says no or a person says no, I think that actually says a bit more about them than anything else. If they're trying to withhold that from you. Because why would you? If I'm a great manager, I'm happy to have you talk to people who I've managed before, even people maybe who I had to let go or something like that, right? I'm confident that those were the right decisions and that those people ended up in a better place and they were taken care of with great care. I would actually make a reference of somebody who I have let go before just so that someone could get a real honest truth of what it was like working with me. So anyways, that's my take on PMF and questions to ask.\n\nLenny (01:03:30):\nI imagine you have PMF with your current world, so maybe just to close, can you just remind folks what you're up to now and where they can find you online and also how listeners can be useful to you?\n\nAdam Fishman (01:03:42):\nFirst, thanks for having me on, Lenny. This was super fun. I love talking about this stuff and it was great chatting with you. So thanks again for having me.\n\nLenny (01:03:50):\nMy pleasure.\n\nAdam Fishman (01:03:51):\nThere are a few ways to get in touch with me. You can follow me and communicate with me on Twitter. My Twitter handle is Fishman, F-I-S-H-M-A-N AF. And I do respond to messages provided that they're polite. And you can also find me on LinkedIn. Those are the two platforms I live on most frequently, for better or for worse. And then I now have this newsletter, fishmanafnewsletter.com. And a lot of what we talked about today are things that I am publishing in written form on that newsletter and plan to continue publishing going forward. And again, it was inspired by the work that you're doing, Lenny.\n\nAdam Fishman (01:04:29):\nSo how can people be helpful to me? I think certainly subscribing to the newsletter and joining that community, telling me about the things that are challenging to them so that I can find ways of finding how they meet up with my interests and translating them into written pieces. And then if you're ever interested in exploring an advisory relationship with me or learning more what that looks like, reach out. I'd love to meet you. Advisory work is what pays the bills right now, and my kids need to eat. I probably need to eat a little less, but my kids need to eat. So reach out about an advisory relationship if you're looking for some help on growth or product or general company building. It's what I do.\n\nLenny (01:05:08):\nAdam, you're so full of insights and lessons, and I'm so happy that you've started writing and sharing a lot of these things. Folks should definitely subscribe. Fishmanafnewsletter.com. Adam, thank you for being here.\n\nAdam Fishman (01:05:18):\nYeah, thanks a lot, Lenny. This was awesome.\n\nLenny (01:05:21):\nThank you so much for listening.
